Perl Scripts used in mauve-analysis
===================================

sub-simple-parser.pl
--------------------
Some simple Clonal Origin XML parser functions.

get_block_length($)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Argument 1: A Clonal Origin XML file.
Return: Length of the block of the XML file.

get_sample_size($)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Argument 1: A Clonal Origin XML file.
Return: Number of Iteration or sample size.

get_species_tree ($)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Argument 1: A Clonal Origin XML file.
Return: Species tree or a clonal frame.

sub-newick-parser.pl
--------------------
Simple newick tree parser functions.

get_number_leave ($)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Argument 1: A string for a newick tree.
Return: Number of taxa at leaves.

extractClonalOriginParameter9.pl
--------------------------------
A first full-fledged Clonal Origin XML parser is needed. wargsim creates a
single XML even if there are multiple blocks. To compare the simulated and the
true one I need to divide a simulated colonal origin XML file into as many as
blocks.

extractClonalOriginParameter10.pl
---------------------------------
I just count the number of recombination events without considering prior
expected number.

extractClonalOriginParameter11.pl
---------------------------------
A directory is given that contains Clonal Origin XML output files: e.g.,
core_co.phase3.1.xml. I subsample recedges across all the blocks. 

report-clonalorigin-job.pl
--------------------------
A number of clonal origin jobs were executed, some of which were not finished
within reasonable time. I do not know why. I cannot use them. Although it would
be desirable to have all of the jobs finished, some jobs may not be finished
practically.
I need to check output files of clonal origin if files conform to clonal
origin's output format.
