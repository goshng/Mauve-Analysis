The six streptococcus genomes
-----------------------------
We investigate gene duplication, losses, horizontal transfer, and bacterial
recombination using the six genomes including 
Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS315 (SPY1),
S. pyogenes MGAS10750 (SPY2),
S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis ATCC 12394 (SDE1),
S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis GGS_124 (SDE2),
S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (SDD),
and S. equi subsp. equi strain 4047 (SEE).
These genomes were studied by Suzuki (2011) for positive selection.
In the recombination analysis we use five of them by removing SEE to increase
the length of genome to analyze.

Inferring duplication, loss, and transfer events
------------------------------------------------
Gene duplications, losses, and horizontal gene transfers (HGT) were identified
using the following methods.  Gene annotations from the species 
SDE1, SDE2, SDD,
SPY1, SPY2, and SEE 
were clustered into gene families using OrthoMCL (Li2003,
Suzuki2011).  For each gene family cluster, the corresponding peptide sequences
were aligned using the MUSCLE program (Edgar2004a).  Nucleotide alignments were
then constructed for each family by mapping nucleotide sequences onto each
peptide alignment, replacing each amino acid with its corresponding codon and
each gap with a triplet of gaps.  Gene trees were then constructed for each
nucleotide alignment using the RAxML program (Stamatakis2006) and
were rooted by minimizing inferred duplications and losses.  Each rooted gene
tree was then reconciled using the Mowgli program (Doyon2011), which inferred
the most parsimonious gene duplication, loss, and transfer events for each
family.  Default values were used for all programs.

Figure 1 shows the inferred gene counts for each extant and ancestral species.
Overall, we find that duplications make up only a small fraction of
the events within the clade (9.6%), while horizontal transfers and
losses are significantly more frequent (37.5% and 52.9%,
respectively).  We also find that duplications are most often
species-specific.  Many gene losses are likely represent horizontal
transfers that replace the native gene sequence.

Inferring bacterial recombination
---------------------------------
Because group A streptococci (GAS) and group C/G streptococci (GCS/GGS) cohabit
the same ecological niche, genetic exchanges between the two groups are
possible.
Genetic exchanges between bacteria are facilitated
by bacterial recombination via transduction, conjugation, and transformation.
Bacterial recombination introduces parts of a donor individual genome 
into a recipient one. 
This process is similar to that of gene conversion rather than homologous
recombination.
By studying genome-wide recombination of bacterial genomes of GAS and GCS/GGS
groups we should be able to investigate exchange of genetic elements between GAS and
GCS/GGS.
Previous studies were limited to housekeeping genes partly because of lack of 
methods of studying bacterial recombination in genome scale, and partly because
of unavailability of relevant bacterial genomes. 
Fortunately, there were recently developed statistical methods of studying
bacterial recombination (Didelot2007, Didelot2010). There were also
more bacterial genomes of GCS/GGS such as
S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis ATCC 12394 (Suzuki2011).

The statistical method of studying bacterial recombination developed by
Didelot2010 uses a reference species tree
inferred using bacterial genomes.  The reference species tree
serves as a back-bone where additional edges, hereafter we refer to as recombinant
edges, are attached to the species tree branches.  
A recombinant edge connects two branches of the reference
tree.  The authors describe that a recombinant edge 
``departs'' from an older time point at a species branch, 
and ``arrives'' at a more recent time point of another species branch.  
The arrival point corresponds to a recombination event
in an ancestral recombination graph (ARG).  
As the reference tree traverses a genome alignment to
meet a recombinant edge, its sister branch of the arrival point is erased and
the recombinant edge replaces it.
Consequently, gene trees change sequentially along a genome.  
This reminisces about gene conversion modeling by Wiuf1999, and the sequential
Markov coalescent due to McVean2005.
Although recombinant edges between two species branches do not denote gene flow
between two species in their original model, Didelot2010 exploited their method
to infer flow of genetic segment between Bacillus cereus species.
We here studied genome-wide recombination of the five streptococcus species 
by applying the method of clonal origin developed by Didelot2010.

The five genomes were aligned using 
progressiveMauve (Darling2004, Darling2010)
with default options that had been 
released on November 11th 2009 with version 2.3.1 at
http://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/download.php.
We removed variable regions from the alignments to leave 
415 alignment blocks that were longer than 500 base pairs.
ClonalFrame version 1.1 that was available at 
http://www.xavierdidelot.xtreemhost.com/clonalframe.htm
was applied to the 415 alignment blocks to estimate a clonal frame, or 
or a species tree of the five genomes (Didelot2007). 
ClonalOrigin with a subversion r19 released on October 1st 2010 was downloaded
from http://clonalorigin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.

The recombinant tract length was estimated to be 795 base pairs.
The mutation rate per site and the recombination rate per site were estimated to
be 0.0805 and 0.0104, respectively. 
Recombinant edges can start before the start position of an alignment block, and
end after the ending position of the block. By counting recombinant edges
starting and ending within an alignment block we can measure number of
recombination events that affect the block.
Figure 2 shows number of recombinant edges per site within an alignment block
along S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis ATCC 12394.
This preliminary study showed that not surprisingly many parts of genomic
regions were under high recombination.
This might indicate that the two groups of GAS and GCS/GGS exchanged genetic
material across the entire genomes not just housekeeping genes.

Figure 3 shows heat maps of logarithm base 2 transformation of
the observed number of recombinant edges relative to the prior
expected number of recombinant edges for each donor/recipient pair in the
species tree of the five genomes.  
The result appears to
indicate that gene flow from _Streptococcus pyogenes_ to
_S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_ was larger than that for the other
direction.

A nucleotide site along a genome under clonal origin model is affected by
recombinant edges with different source and destination species tree branches.
By counting recombinant edge types on a nucleotide site and averaging it over
the nucleotides of a gene we were able to measure recombination intensity on a
gene.

IMPORTANT: GO Analysis by Melissa and the results should be here.

Three functional
categories show higher recombination: biosynthesis in fatty acid and
phospholipid metabolism, phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase
system (PTS) in signal transduction, and tRNA aminoacylation in protein fate.
