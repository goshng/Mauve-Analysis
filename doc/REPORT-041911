Because group A streptococci (GAS) and group C/G streptococci (GCS/GGS) cohabit
the same ecological niche, genetic exchanges between the two groups are
possible.
Genetic exchanges between bacterial individuals are facilitated
by bacterial recombination via transduction, conjugation, and transformation.
Bacterial recombination introduces parts of a donor individual genome 
into a recipient one. 
The process is similar to that of gene conversion rather than homologous
recombination.
By studying genome-wide recombination of bacterial genomes of GAS and GCS/GGS
groups we are able to investigate exchange of genetic elements between GAS and
GCS/GGS.
Previous studies were limited to housekeeping genes partly because of lack of 
methods of studying bacterial recombination in genome scale, and partly because
of unavailability of relevant bacterial genomes. 
Fortunately, there were recently developed statistical methods of studying
bacterial recombination (Didelot2007, Didelot2010). There were also release of
more bacterial genomes of GCS/GGS such as
S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis ATCC 12394 (Suzuki2011).
We studied genome-wide recombination of the five streptococcus species including
Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS315,
S. pyogenes MGAS10750,
S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis GGS_124,
S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis ATCC 12394, and
S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae. 
These genomes and S. equi subsp. equi strain 4047
were studied by Suzuki (2011) for positive selection.

Number of recombinant edges per site within a block
along S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis ATCC 12394

Our preliminary study showed that not surprisingly many parts of genomic regions were under
high recombination .

The two groups were shown to exchange genetic
material across the entire genomes not just housekeeping genes (Figure X).

2. 
It also showed that overall more genetic elements flowed
from GAS to GCS/GGS than the other direction (Figure X).

3. 
Three functional
categories show higher recombination: biosynthesis in fatty acid and
phospholipid metabolism, phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase
system (PTS) in signal transduction, and tRNA aminoacylation in protein fate
(Figure X).

Mike, I'm travelling, but Sang Chul, Matt, and Melissa should be able to get you
something by Wed.  Folks, please send Mike a brief description of progress so
far on the recombination/gain/loss/LGT work (roughly 1 page), focusing on
overall goals and major findings so far.  If you have any figures, you could
send those along as well.  Melissa, it would be great if you could take an
editing pass before sending.  Please cc me.  I'll be back Thurs and can have a
look then.
Thanks,
Adam
