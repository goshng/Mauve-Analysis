Manual of Mauve Analysis
========================
Sang_Chul_Choi <goshng@yahoo.co.kr>

Introduction
------------
This manual introduces a how-to of *Mauve Analysis* of closely related bacterial
genomes using ClonalOrigin. The analysis can be performed with help of other
software packages. See the section <<Installation>> for detailed installation 
of the software packages.
*Mauve Analysis* is a package of scripts including BASH shell scripts, PERL
scripts, and source codes in language C. Users do not need directly run those
scripts. Instead, they should execute the script +run+ at the base directory.
Note that directories are referred with respect to the base directory of 
*Mauve Analysis* package.

.To execute the main menu of *Mauve Analysis*
----
$ ./run
----
would list menus, among which users can select by typing in a number for one of 
menus that users wish to execute.
Follow the instruction in the menu that you choose. When you
unziped *Mauve Analysis* package, you need to <<Configuration,configure>> 
an analysis and <<Installation,install>> necessary software packages. 
After the installation of helper software packages and the configuration of the
analysis, a <<species,species file>> is needed before analyzing bacterial
genomes. Impatient users can see the section <<Kickstart>> to start to analyze
their selected bacterial genomes.

Initialize the file system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Execute the menu *init-file-system* after the configuration of the analysis and
the installation of the analysis. This will create +output+ directory
in the base directory, and base directories in the cluster and X11-enabled linux
machine. You might need a cluster of unix-like machines for running
ClonalOrigin, and might also need a linux machine to run a program with
graphical interface.

Align your genomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step of ClonalOrigin analysis is to align bacterial genomes.
Use menu *prepare-mauve-alignment*, and *receive-mauve-alignment* for this. The
first menu creates a shell script and moves it to the cluster with the bacterial
genomes specified in the species file. When the job of bacterial genome
alignment is finished, users can use the second menu to receive the full alignment. 
A bacterial genome alignment consists of blocks of multiple alignments. Users
might want to use parts of the blocks.  Menu *filter-blocks* should be used to
remove blocks that are not large so that a core alignment is prepared.  Users
have to specify the limit of block size for this. The menu calls a program
+stripSubsetLCBs+, which is a part of ClonalOrigin package. At the end of the
menu *filter-blocks* users might want to skim the core alignment to remove
blocks with many gaps.  Remove blocks manually because
all of the downstream analyses depend on this alignment. There are no
recommendation for the choice of block size limit. 
A simulation approach can be helpful in deciding the
block size limit. I will come back to this issue in a separate section.

Infer the species tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Congratulations! You are now ready to analyze the core alignment using
ClonalOrigin and ClonalFrame developed by Xavier Didelot. Although there are other
coauthors of the package, I want to thank him for his help in my initial
analysis. Let's go back to work. Use menu *summary-core-alignment* to summarize
the core alignment for basic statistics of the core alignment: total length of
the core alignment, number of blocks, and block sizes. Use menu
*prepare-run-clonalframe* to prepare a shell
script to submit a job of ClonalFrame, and send it to the cluster along with the
core alignment. Use menu *receive-run-clonalframe* to receive the result of the
ClonalFrame job. ClonalOrigin's analysis is multi-staged MCMC, which means that
a procedure of a Bayesian stistical inference depends on its previous one.
ClonalFrame is one of the precedures, and ClonalOrigin is used twice. Users have
to make sure convergence of each step. Menu *prepare-run-clonalframe* runs
multiple executions of ClonalFrame. Users should check the convergence of those
chains by inspecting the result files of ClonalFrame runs. Use the GUI of
ClonalFrame to open the MCMC results for this.  If the convergence is
not obtained, users might increase the block size limit or change the run
options of ClonalFrame.

Infer mutation and recombination rates and recombinant tract lengths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The second MCMC procedure is done using menu *prepare-run-clonalorigin*, which
prepares a shell script to submit a job of the first stage of ClonalOrigin.
Use menu *receive-run-clonalorigin* to receive all of the result files of
the first ClonalOrigin. Users can use menu *summarize-clonalorigin1* and
*scatter-plot-parameter* to summarize the first stage of ClonalOrigin MCMC.
Menu *summarize-clonalorigin1* creates two files: +unfinished+ and +median.txt+. 
Menu *scatter-plot-parameter* creates a figure like Figure 4 of Didelot2010.
Menu *plot-number-recombination-within-blocks* can be also used to create a
figure like Figure 6 of Didelot2010.

_Do we need a menu for checking convergence of the ClonalOrigin's 1st stage?_

Infer recombinant tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The third MCMC procedure is performed using menu *prepare-run-2nd-clonalorigin*
and *receive-run-2nd-clonalorigin*. A figure like Figure 5 of Didelot2010 can be
created using three menus of *count-observed-recedge*,
*compute-prior-count-recedge*, and *compute-heatmap-recedge*. 
Menu *prepare-run-compute-heatmap-recedge* might be useful if 
menu *compute-heatmap-recedge* is slow.  

Heat map of the recombinant tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users can use menu *recombination-intensity1-map* to summarize recombinant edges
along the alignment blocks. This information can be combined with gene
annotations to measure how much genes are under recombination. A list of genes
can be created using menu *create-ingene*. The recombination intensity map
created by menu *recombination-intensity1-map* and the gene annotations can be
used to find gene-wise recombination intensity using menu 
*recombination-intensity1-genes*. This gene-wise intensity can be used to do
functional category analysis. _I need to find the functional category analysis
that Melissa developed._ Menu *recombination-intensity1-probability* can be use
to create figures that are similar to Figures 2 and 7 of Didelot2010. 
Functional category analysis with the result from
*recombination-intensity1-genes* and figures from 
*recombination-intensity1-probability* could be helpful in overview of genes
with high recombination. It is not obvious which genes are interesting enough to
be under high recombination. Menu *probability-recedge-gene* searches for genes
with high recombination probability with edge types.

Functional category association with recombination edges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Menu *create-ingene* creates a file with genes. I need to find columns in the
alignment blocks that corresponds to those genes. There are two ways of mapping
genes in the alignment blocks. One is that we first find a recombination
intensity along the blocks, and find genes in the block to compute recombination
intensity of the genes. Another is that we can have a recombination intensity
on one of reference genome, and find genes in the reference genome to compute
recombination intensity. Either way should give the same result. I used the
latter approach because I thought that finding genes in blocks can be easily
done if recombination intensity is mapped on a reference genome. This
complicates the recombination intensity computation, and I would have to have
duplicates of recombination intensity map for multiple reference genomes. I will
try to use the former approach. It seems more intuitive. Then, I need to work on
menu *create-ingene* more because genes should be mapped on blocks. I need to
map each site of a gene to its corresponding site in a block. After having one
with *create-ingene* I can do something in menus
*recombination-intensity1-genes* and *recombination-intensity1-probability*.

These two should be used to list genes and locate them in blocks.
*convert-gff-ingene*
*locate-gene-in-block*

Menu *probability-recombination* may not be used. I could delete this menu.

.Some post-processing procedures follow clonal origin runs.
. recombination-intensity: A recombinant edge is classifed by its departure and
arrival species tree branches. The number of types of recombinant edges could
have been equal to the sqaure of the number of species tree branches including
the rooting edge. Let the number of species tree branches L. A nucleotide site
is affected by only a single recombinant edge type.  I can have a matrix of
size L-by-L, each element of which is a binary value that represents that the
corresponding site is affected by the recombinant edge with departure of the
row index of the element, and arrival of the column index of it. Note that
some of elements must be always 0 because their recombinant edge types are
impossible.

. recombination-intensity2: This uses the output file from
recombination-intensity menu; it must be called after the call of
recombination-intensity. The output of recombination-intensity is a series of
matrices.  Each line starts with a position number that represents a site in a
genome. The position is followed by a L*L many integers. These numbers are
elements of a matrix of size L-by-L. Numbers in the elements can be larger
than 1 because each element is the sum of binary values over the MCMC
iterations of ClonalOrigin. The number ranges from 0 to the size of
iterations. I have to divide numbers in the elements by the number of
iterations to obtain average values. I want to consider the number of
recombinant edge types that affect a site as a measure of recombination
intensity. The total number of recombination edge types that affect a
nucleotide site is just the sum of all of the elements of the matrix of size
L-by-L.

recombination-intensity3: This uses the output file from
recombination-intensity2 menu. It draws the distribution of numbers of
recombinant edge types over sites of all of the alignment blocks.
recombination-intensity.eps shows the distribution.

More literature search for studies of bacterial recombination.

ucsc-load-genome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I load the 6 species to a local UCSC genome browser.

extract-species-tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The input species file is given from the *ClonalFrame* analysis. *ClonalOrigin*
uses the species file, but indices of branches in the tree are modified by
*ClonalOrigin*. I need to use the modified species tree to interpret the output
of *ClonalOrigin*. This menu extracts the species tree from an XML file
+$RUNCLONALORIGIN/output2/$REPLICATE/core_co.phase3.xml.1+ and produces a file 
+$RUNANALYSIS/species-tree-$REPLICATE.tree+.

summarize-clonalorigin1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first stage of _ClonalOrigin_ results in population mutation rate,
recombination rate, and average tract length. The menu uses output files from
the first stage or files with prefix of 
+$RUNCLONALORIGIN/output/$REPLICATE/core_co.phase2.xml+  
to compute the three parameters. They are saved in file
+$RUNCLONALORIGIN/summary/$REPLICATE/median.txt+. Additionally, unfinished
blocks are saved in 
+$RUNCLONALORIGIN/summary/$REPLICATE/unfinished+. 

compute-block-length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two +core_alignment.xmfa+ files: one in +data+ directory and another in
+run-mauve+. The one in data directory is produced using the other in run-mauve
directory. The alignment program mauve produces +core_alignment.xmfa+, which is
filtered by deleting blocks of many gaps. The menu uses the
+core_alignment.xmfa+
in data directory to creates block lengths in a file +$RUNANALYSIS/in.block+. The
same file is copied to +data/$SPECIES-$REPETITION-in.block+.

simulate-data-clonalorigin2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Three values of the three main parameters, and a species tree are given to
ClonalOrigin simulator, ``wargsim,'' to generate sequence data. For each
repetition a new recombinant species tree is simulated, which is then used to
generate data under Jukes-Cantor model of DNA sequence evolution.

prepare-run-clonalorigin2-simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This command is followed by ``simulate-data-clonalorigin2'' menu. 

receive-run-clonalorigin2-simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When simulations s10, s11, and s12 were finished, I fetched the results from the
computing cluster. Just select the simulation, and wait for the shell prompt.


analyze-run-clonalorigin2-simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simulation s10 generates 100 replicates of a single block using ClonalOrigin
model where the three main parameters, recombinant edges, and species tree are
fixed. I know a set of true recombinant edges. The numbers of recombinant edges
between pairs of species branches are of my interest. I wish to check how well 
the 100 simulations can recover the true numbers of recombinant edges.

Simulation s11 generates 10 replicates of a 100-block using ClonalOrigin model.
The three main parameters, recombinant edges, and a species tree are fixed. The
numbers of recombinant edges between pairs of species branches are known. I wish
to check how well the 10 simulations can recover the true numbers of recombinant
edges.

The simulated recombinant edges are stored in:

  if ( y[,i] < slower || y[,i] > supper ) { 
    print (paste(i,"not okay"))
  }     
  print (paste(sep="     ",i,round(y[,i],digit=3),round(mean(x[,i]),digit=3),v,round(s,digit=3),slower,supper))
}
----

Simulation s12 generates 10 repetitions of 10 replicates of a 71-block using
ClonalOrigin model. 
The three main parameters, recombinant edges, and a species tree were obtained
from cornellf/8. The cornellf/8 run used the minimum limit of 5,000 base pairs
for blocks. This resulted in 71 blocks. I sampled 101 recombinant trees, 10 of
which were used for the 10 repetitions. 
I wish to check how well the 100 simulations can recover the true numbers of
recombinant edges. 


receive-run-2nd-clonalorigin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once jobs in the computing cluster are finished, select this command to receive
the results from the cluster. Choose SPECIES, REPETITION, and REPLICATE to
receive your runs from the cluster. It also ask a job ID, which is the job ID of
run-mauve directory. You can find it in the 2nd line of the mauve alignment
file:

WARNING: receive-run-2nd-clonalorigin may be split into two parts. The first
part is to download the result, and the second part is to do something about it. 

scatter-plot-parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

compute-prior-count-recedge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Compute the prior expected numbers of recombinant edges given a species tree.
The clonal origin's companion program called ``gui'' is used. 
Select your SPECIES, REPETITION, and REPLICATE to choose a proper run from which
you wish to compute the prior expected number of recombinant edges.
The program ``gui'' runs on each block. It reads in a ClonalOrigin XML output
file of the 2nd stage MCMC. For example, the following file is read in for
SPECIES=cornellf, REPETITION=8, and REPLICATE=2:

.ClonalOrigin XML file

count-observed-recedge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only observed recombinant edges are considered.

compute-heatmap-recedge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Observed recombinant edges and the prior expected number of recombinant edges
both are considered.
Menu compute-prior-count-recedge must be called before the call of this menu.
 
map-tree-topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A ClonalOrigin XML output file contains a list of recombinant trees. The number
of recombinant trees is equal to the the number of Iteration tags. A modified
program wargsim can parse a ClonalOrigin XML file with a single recombinant
tree. The ClonalOrigin XML output file with multiple recombinant trees have to
divided to multiple XML files, each of which contains a single recombinant tree.

Some of recombinant trees may not be processible by wargsim, or wargsim can
crash when parsing a ClonalOrigin XML file. I check if the number of tree
topology indices and the size of a block are equal. If they are not equal, they
should be removed in further analysis.

Conceptually divided posterior samples should be recombined.

SIMULATION3
~~~~~~~~~~~

Recombination intensity based on the average number of recombinant edge types
per site is tested.

analyze-run-clonalorigin2-simulation2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using a local computer with a single CPU I can analyze the result of menu
simulate-data-clonalorigin2. 

analyze-run-clonalorigin2-simulation2-prepare
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A number of simulation replicates are analyzed by using a cluster.

convert-gff-ingene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I use a gene annotation file that accompanies the genbank bacterial genome file.
NCBI's ftp directory called bacteria contains complete genomes of bacteria and
archiea. A genbank file could be used to locate genes in the genome of the
genbank file. I instead use a companion file called gff file to extract gene
locations. An example of 

.A genome annotation gff file
----
Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS315_uid57911/NC_004070.gff
----

Gene locations are stored an ingene file. The file has four columns that are
delimited by a tab: gene name, start position, end position, and gene strand.
An ingene file is created in run-analysis of a repetition directory.

output/cornellf/8/run-analysis/in.gene

locate-gene-in-block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Genes in an +ingene+ file are mapped to block alignments that are used
in ClonalOrigin inference. The following information is written to
+ingene.referenceGenomeID.block+ file:
gene start end strand blockidGene blockStart blockEnd geneStartInBlock
geneEndInBlock lenSeq gap. Genes with larger than 50 are considered. 

.An ingene block file is created.

clonalorigin2-simulation3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I wish to check how map of tree topology can be helpful. 

I can still use the previous
simulation, or s10, s11, and s13. I assume that a gene is 1,000 base pairs
long. I compute recombination intensity for regions of 1,000 base pairs long.
For simulation s10 and s11 I would have 10 regions of 1,000 base pairs long
for a block. For s13 I would use genes from the real data, or genes of M3
strains. I might have to use the cluster because the computation of
recombination intensity appears slow.

clonalorigin2-simulation3-prepare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The simulation for map-tree-topology is done in a cluster.

clonalorigin2-simulation3-each-block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Menu clonalorigin2-simulation3-prepare,
clonalorigin2-simulation3-receive, and 
clonalorigin2-simulation3-analyze may not be successful in analyzing a sequence
alignment. Local genes trees from the sample using ClonalOrigin may be invalid.
Among numerous simulations there are several cases of block alignments where
this happens. In this case I have redo the simulation for those blocks. I need
SPECIES, REPETITION, REPLICATE, BLOCK, and BLOCKSIZE. After this correction, I
can proceed with clonalorigin2-simulation3-analyze.

recombination-intensity1-map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For simplicity, I create a file called +$RUNANALYSIS/rimap-$REPLICATE.txt+ where
the number of lines is equal to the total length of all of the block alignments.
This file could be huge in size. The file of block sizes and the XMFA alignment
file should be used to find a corresponding block of recombination events counts
for a reference genome. The species tree 
+$RUNANALYSIS/species-tree-$REPLICATE.tree+ should be used to find which
branches correspond to which element in the +rimap+ file. 

Given this +rimap+ file I could create recombination intensity or average number
of recombinant edges along a reference genome. However, 
it appears that menu *recombination-intensity1-map* features recombination event
counts along a reference genome.

recombination-intensity1-genes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The number of recombinant edges per site is computed for all of the genes of a
reference genome. recombination-intensity1-map must be called before the call of
this menu.

list-gene-go
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Melissa provided a file of gene ontology terms and their descriptions,
SpyMGAS315_go_category_names.txt,
and a file of gene names and their association with multiple gene ontology
terms,
SpyMGAS315_go_bacteria.txt. Using these files we list genes and their product
names for a given gene ontology term.

probability-recedge-gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Posterior probability of recombination is computed for each gene and each
recombinant edge type.

Files
-----

sh/run.sh
~~~~~~~~~
This is the key run file to analyze bacterial genome data sets using
ClonalOrigin. A menu is displayed so that a user can choose an operation that
she or he wants to execute. Some commands do their job on their own right, and
others require users to go to a cluster to submit a job. Each menu is executed
by its corresponding bash function. Locate the bash function to see
what it does. 

Menus:
  - choose-species: makes file system for a species, and make it ready to run
  mauve.
  - receive-run-mauve: gets the result of mauve alignment from the cluster
  - prepare-run-clonalframe: finds blocks and makes a script to run
  clonalframe.
  - compute-watterson-estimate-for-clonalframe: (optional)
  - receive-run-clonalframe: receives the result of clonal frame analysis.
  - prepare-run-clonalorigin: makes a script for clonal origin analysis.
  - receive-run-clonalorigin: receives the result of the first stage of clonal
  origin analysis. 
  - receive-run-2nd-clonalorigin: receives the result of the second stage of
  clonal analysis.

Replicates and repetitions.
---------------------------
The output directory contains different analyses. They can be different in
their raw data or their purposes of analyses. For example, the output
directory can contain cornell5 for the 5 genomes of Streptococcus. It can
contain bacillus for the genomes that Didelot et al. (2010) used. It can also
contain a directory called s1 that includes analyses of one of simulation
studies. REPETITION macro is mainly used for the purpose of simulation
studies. A number of repetitons in a simulation study can performed. One
repetition can be different from another. For real data analyses repetitions
can be done at different time points. They can also be different in some of
their filtering steps, which could result in different temporary data.

In simulation for second stage of Clonal Origin a clonal frame and recombinant
edges are fixed to generate a number of DNA sequence alignments. A number of
replicates are generated with a given clonal frame and its recombinant edges
fixed. A number of repetitions are performed and each repetition would have
a different set of recombinant edges. I am not sure what this kind of two
levels of repeated experiments can do for me. I could generate data with a
clonal frame with its recombinant edges where a set of recombinant edges can
come from one iteration of ClonalOrigin output.
