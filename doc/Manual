Mauve-Analysis configuration
----------------------------
A directory at the root of mauve-analysis is called +conf+. Users must configure
mauve-analysis by editting +README.template+ and rename it as +README+. 
Users are strongly encouraged to obtain a user ID at a cluster of computers
because multiple jobs could be run in parallel to reduce the total amount of
time.

Installation
------------
Several software need to be installed.

Mauve
~~~~~
Mauve is a genome alignment software.

ClonalFrame
~~~~~~~~~~~
ClonalFrame is ...

ClonalOrigin
~~~~~~~~~~~~
ClonalOrigin is the main program used in this analysis.

ClonalOrigin Simulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Steps to compile wargsim
----
cd mauve-analysis/src/clonalorigin
mkdir b
cd b
cmake ..
make
----

Menus
-----
Users can perform jobs by selecting menus by running a bash script called
sh/run.sh. 
.Executing the main bash script
----
bash sh/run.sh
----

choose-simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users have to setup simulation configuration including mostly creating
directories.

simulate-data-clonalorigin2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Three values of the three main parameters, and a species tree are given to
ClonalOrigin simulator, ``wargsim,'' to generate sequence data. For each
repetition a new recombinant species tree is simulated, which is then used to
generate data under Jukes-Cantor model of DNA sequence evolution.

prepare-run-clonalorigin2-simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This command is followed by ``simulate-data-clonalorigin2'' menu. 

receive-run-clonalorigin2-simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When simulations s10, s11, and s12 were finished, I fetched the results from the
computing cluster. Just select the simulation, and wait for the shell prompt.


analyze-run-clonalorigin2-simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simulation s10 generates 100 replicates of a single block using ClonalOrigin
model where the three main parameters, recombinant edges, and species tree are
fixed. I know a set of true recombinant edges. The numbers of recombinant edges
between pairs of species branches are of my interest. I wish to check how well 
the 100 simulations can recover the true numbers of recombinant edges.

Simulation s11 generates 10 replicates of a 100-block using ClonalOrigin model.
The three main parameters, recombinant edges, and a species tree are fixed. The
numbers of recombinant edges between pairs of species branches are known. I wish
to check how well the 10 simulations can recover the true numbers of recombinant
edges.

The simulated recombinant edges are stored in:

.File of the true recombinant edges 
----
output/s11/1/data/core_alignment.xml
----

The counts of recombinant edges from simulation are stored in:

.File of counts of recombinant edges from simulation
----
output/s11/run-analysis/s11-heatmap.txt
----

The true counts of recombinant edges are stored in:

.File of true counts of recombinant edges
----
output/s11/run-analysis/s11-yes-heatmap.txt
----

.R script file for s11
----
output/s11/run-analysis/1.R
----

.R script of comparison
----
x <- read.table("s11-heatmap.txt")
y <- read.table("s11-yes-heatmap.txt")

for (i in 1:81) {
  v <- round(mean(x[,i]) - y[,i],digit=3)
  s <- mean(x[,i+81])
  supper <- round(mean(x[,i]) + 2*s,digit=3) 
  slower <- round(mean(x[,i]) - 2*s,digit=3) 
  if ( y[,i] < slower || y[,i] > supper ) { 
    print (paste(i,"not okay"))
  }     
  print (paste(sep="     ",i,round(y[,i],digit=3),round(mean(x[,i]),digit=3),v,round(s,digit=3),slower,supper))
}
----

Simulation s12 generates 10 repetitions of 10 replicates of a 71-block using
ClonalOrigin model. 
The three main parameters, recombinant edges, and a species tree were obtained
from cornellf/8. The cornellf/8 run used the minimum limit of 5,000 base pairs
for blocks. This resulted in 71 blocks. I sampled 101 recombinant trees, 10 of
which were used for the 10 repetitions. 
I wish to check how well the 100 simulations can recover the true numbers of
recombinant edges. 


receive-run-2nd-clonalorigin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once jobs in the computing cluster are finished, select this command to receive
the results from the cluster. Choose SPECIES, REPETITION, and REPLICATE to
receive your runs from the cluster. It also ask a job ID, which is the job ID of
run-mauve directory. You can find it in the 2nd line of the mauve alignment
file:

----
#Sequence1File  /tmp/1081728.scheduler.v4linux/input/CP002215.gbk
----

WARNING: receive-run-2nd-clonalorigin may be split into two parts. The first
part is to download the result, and the second part is to do something about it. 

scatter-plot-parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

compute-prior-count-recedge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Compute the prior expected numbers of recombinant edges given a species tree.
The clonal origin's companion program called ``gui'' is used. 
Select your SPECIES, REPETITION, and REPLICATE to choose a proper run from which
you wish to compute the prior expected number of recombinant edges.
The program ``gui'' runs on each block. It reads in a ClonalOrigin XML output
file of the 2nd stage MCMC. For example, the following file is read in for
SPECIES=cornellf, REPETITION=8, and REPLICATE=2:

.ClonalOrigin XML file
----
output/cornellf/8/run-clonalorigin/output2/2/core_co.phase3.xml.1
----

.File of prior expected number of recombinant edges
----
output/cornellf/8/run-clonalorigin/output2/priorcount-2/1.txt
----

count-observed-recedge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only observed recombinant edges are considered.

compute-heatmap-recedge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Observed recombinant edges and the prior expected number of recombinant edges
both are considered.
Menu compute-prior-count-recedge must be called before the call of this menu.
 
map-tree-topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A ClonalOrigin XML output file contains a list of recombinant trees. The number
of recombinant trees is equal to the the number of Iteration tags. A modified
program wargsim can parse a ClonalOrigin XML file with a single recombinant
tree. The ClonalOrigin XML output file with multiple recombinant trees have to
divided to multiple XML files, each of which contains a single recombinant tree.

.A ClonalOrigin XML output file: REPETITION=8, REPLICATE=2, BLOCK=1
----
output/cornellf/8/run-clonalorigin/output2/2/core_co.phase3.xml.1
----

Splitted ClonalOrigin XML files are stored in ri-# directory where # represents
REPLICATE.

.A ClonalOrigin XML output file with a single recombinant tree: REPETITION=8,
REPLICATE=2, BLOCK=1, ITERATION=1
----
output/cornellf/8/run-clonalorigin/output2/ri-2/core_co.phase3.xml.1.1
----

To each splitted ClonalOrigin XML file is wargsim applied. Each output file is
saved in ri-#-out directory where # represents REPLICATE.

REPLICATE=2, BLOCK=1, ITERATION=1
----
output/cornellf/8/run-clonalorigin/output2/ri-2-out/core_co.phase3.xml.1.1
----

Some of recombinant trees may not be processible by wargsim, or wargsim can
crash when parsing a ClonalOrigin XML file. I check if the number of tree
topology indices and the size of a block are equal. If they are not equal, they
should be removed in further analysis.

Conceptually divided posterior samples should be recombined.

SIMULATION3
~~~~~~~~~~~

Recombination intensity based on the average number of recombinant edge types
per site is tested.

analyze-run-clonalorigin2-simulation2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using a local computer with a single CPU I can analyze the result of menu
simulate-data-clonalorigin2. 

analyze-run-clonalorigin2-simulation2-prepare
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A number of simulation replicates are analyzed by using a cluster.

convert-gff-ingene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I use a gene annotation file that accompanies the genbank bacterial genome file.
NCBI's ftp directory called bacteria contains complete genomes of bacteria and
archiea. A genbank file could be used to locate genes in the genome of the
genbank file. I instead use a companion file called gff file to extract gene
locations.

.A genome annotation gff file
----
Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS315_uid57911/NC_004070.gff
----

Gene locations are stored an ingene file. The file has four columns that are
delimited by a tab: gene name, start position, end position, and gene strand.
An ingene file is created in run-analysis of a repetition directory.

.An ingene file
----
output/cornellf/8/run-analysis/in.gene
----

locate-gene-in-block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All of the gene in an ingene file are mapped to block alignments that are used
in ClonalOrigin inference. Five more columns are appended to the ingene file:
block ID, start and end position of a gene in the block, gene length, and
proportions of gaps in the gene.

----
output/cornellf/8/run-analysis/in.gene
----

clonalorigin2-simulation3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I wish to check how map of tree topology can be helpful. 

I can still use the previous
simulation, or s10, s11, and s13. I assume that a gene is 1,000 base pairs
long. I compute recombination intensity for regions of 1,000 base pairs long.
For simulation s10 and s11 I would have 10 regions of 1,000 base pairs long
for a block. For s13 I would use genes from the real data, or genes of M3
strains. I might have to use the cluster because the computation of
recombination intensity appears slow.

clonalorigin2-simulation3-prepare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The simulation for map-tree-topology is done in a cluster.

clonalorigin2-simulation3-each-block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Menu clonalorigin2-simulation3-prepare,
clonalorigin2-simulation3-receive, and 
clonalorigin2-simulation3-analyze may not be successful in analyzing a sequence
alignment. Local genes trees from the sample using ClonalOrigin may be invalid.
Among numerous simulations there are several cases of block alignments where
this happens. In this case I have redo the simulation for those blocks. I need
SPECIES, REPETITION, REPLICATE, BLOCK, and BLOCKSIZE. After this correction, I
can proceed with clonalorigin2-simulation3-analyze.
