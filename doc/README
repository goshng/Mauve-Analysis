Abstract
--------
Flow of genomic regions between _Streptococcus pyogenes_ and 
_S. dysgalactiae_ subspecies _equisimilis_ 
is investigated using five genomes including _S.
dysgalactiae_ spp. _dysgalactiae_.  Unidirectional flow of genomic regions
from _S. pyogenes_ to _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ is more prevalent
than the other direction.  
Two competing hypotheses on the evolution of the two species are tested.
I privide more evidence for hypothesis 1 with detailed view of evolutionary
history of the two Streptococci species.

Introduction
------------

GCS/GGS and GAS colonize the same ecological niche
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where?

GCS/GGS and GAS exhibit overlap in their disease profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What disease profiles?

Virulence factors associated with disease
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What virulence factors?
[Davies2007] studied 216 GAS virulence genes, not other genes
to profile the virulence gene repertoires of many (or 58) 
_Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ isolates recovered during human
infections.

What is disease propensity?

A Question of interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ had been known to infect
domesticated animals (CITEs).
Recently, reports that _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ (SDE) were recovered as
human pathogens just like _S. pyogenes_ (SPY) are increasing (CITEs).  
Although SDE and
SPY form distinct genotypic contents, pathogenic phenotypes of the two species
manifest similarly (CITEs).
How did SDE evolve? Did it evolve from an ancestral form of pathogenic bateria?
Did it evolve from a commensal bacteria? Did genetic elements transfer from
SPY's lineage to SDE's? Or, were there cases of the opposite direction of gene
flow? In this study, I want to catalogue genetic elements according to their
pattern of flow in the evolutionary history that relates SPY and SDE. 

Scenarios of evolution of SPY and SDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. The most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is a GAS-like pathogen. SDE
was losing virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor. SDE regains
virulence factors from SPY because of the same niche.
2. The most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is a GGS/GCS-like commensal.
SPY evolves virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor. SDE gains
virulence factors from SPY.



Methods and Materials
---------------------

Bacterial genomes from NCBI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I use two genomes of _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_, two genomes of 
_Streptococcus pyogenes_, and one genome of _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _dysgalactiae_.
Two genomes of _S. pyogenes_ were downloaded from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes: 
Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS315_uid57911/NC_004070.gbk [Beres2002]
and 
Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS10750_uid58575/NC_008024.gbk [Beres2006].
A genome Genbank file of _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ was found at 
Streptococcus_dysgalactiae_equisimilis_GGS_124_uid59103/NC_012891.gbk.
Two more genomes were provided by (CITEs):
cornell_sde1/SdeqATCC12394.gbk 
and
cornell_sdd/SddyATCC27957.gbk.
I refer the two genomes of MGAS315 and MGAS1075 as SPY1 and SPY2, respectively. 
The two genomes of SdeqATCC12394.gbk and GGS_124 are referred to as SDE1 and
SDE2, respectively. The genome of Genbank file SddyATCC27957.gbk is called SDD.

I followed the tutorial provided at
http://code.google.com/p/clonalorigin.

Genome alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I downloaded progressiveMauve version 2.3.1, released on November 11th 2009 from 
http://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/download.php.
Default options were used to align the five _Streptococcus_ genomes. 
I removed variable regions from the alignment to leave 
419 alignment blocks that are longer than 500 base pair.

ClonalFrame
~~~~~~~~~~~
I downloaded ClonalFrame version 1.1 at
http://www.xavierdidelot.xtreemhost.com/clonalframe.htm.
I applied ClonalFrame to the 419 core alignment blocks to obtain a clonal frame,
or a species tree of the five species.
Three independent runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo were executed with a total
generation of chains being 20,000. The first 10,000 generations were discarded
as burn-in. 

ClonalOrigin
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I downloaded a subversion r19 of ClonalOrigin, released on October 1st 2010 from
http://clonalorigin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.
Two independent runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo chain with ClonalOrigin were
made with a total generation of each chain being 2,100,000. The first 1,100,000
generations of each chain were discarded as burn-in. The remaining 1,000,000
generations were subsampled every 10,000 generations, leaving a posterior sample
of size 100. I obtained an estimate of population parameters such as mutation
rate, recombination rate, and recombinant tract length. 
A second stage of Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure was executed with
ClonalOrigin by fixing the population parameters to the estimated values. This
allowed to obtain a posterior sample of recombinant edges. Two independent
chains of Markov chain Montel Carlo with ClonalOrigin were executed with a total
generation being 11,100,000. The first 1,100,000 generations of each chain were
discarded as burn-in. The remaining 10,000,000 generations were subsampled every
100,000 generations, leaving a sample of size 100.

Bacterial genome annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MGAS315 (NC_004070.gbk) or other _S. pyogenes_ genomes might have genome
annotations. 

How do I know functional categories of genes?
No citations were made in [Davies2007] about the categorization. 
A block can contain multiple genes.
I think that I need to know how I can categorize genetic elements of MGAS315
genome.

Summary of gene flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I want to develop scripts to summarize gene flow of a genomic segment given a
speices tree. A genomic segment includes protein-coding genes or non-coding
elements.
I like Figures 2, 5, and 7 of Didelot's ClonalOrigin paper. For
each site or a window of a contiguous segment, a figure just like Figure 5 can
be depicted. As I scan through a genomic segment by site or window, dynamic
changes to the figure similiar to Figure 5 would show fluctuation of gene flow
of the genomic segment.
How can I summarize gene flows properly from a posterior sample of recombinant
edges?
Or, I could use figures such as Figures 2 and 7 to describe results
qualitatively. I may have to do this.



Discussion
----------

Lack of analyses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only two genomes of _S. pyogenes_ were used.
Only two genomes of _S. dysgalactiae_ subspecies _equisimilis_ were used.
Analyses with more isolates could potentially reveal congruent relationships
between virulence profiles and GCS/GGS disease propensity.

I did not account for gene gain and loss in the analysis. Only well aligned
regions were used in the analysis.

MLST
----
- Based on housekeeping genes,
- Tools used for population genetics study of a bacterial species,

Analysis Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- eBURST analysis (Feil et al., 2004) can infer the ancestor-descendant
  relationships between sequence types (ST),
- Empirical analysis of genetic change in single-locus variants (SLVs) (Feil et
  al., 2000),
- ClonalFrame uses a coalescent-based approach to estimate the relative
  probabilities that a nucleotide is changed as the result of homologous
  recombnation versus point muation (Didelot and Falush, 2007),
- Infinite allele model can estimate population recombination and mutation rates
  (Fraser et al., 2005; Hanage et al., 2006),
- Congruency of gene tree topologies can evaluate the relative extent of genetic
  diversification by recombination versus mutation by assessing congruence via
  pairwise comparisons of housekeeping gene tree topologies (Feil et al., 2001;
  see also Bessen, 2009),

Recombinations and Mutations
----------------------------
The high rates of recombination characterize most _Streptococcus_ species.


Streptococcus Genomes Available
-------------------------------
- pneumococci (Tettelin et al., 2001)
- GAS (Ferretti et al., 2001)
- GBS (Tettelin et al., 2002)
- _S. equi_
- _S. zooepidemicus_
- _S. gordonii_
- _S. mutans_
- _S. mitis_
- _S. suis_
- _S. uberis_
The _Streptococcus_ genomes range in size from ~1.7 to 2.2 Mb.

Genomic Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exogenous genetic elements
- prophages
- integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs)
- conjugative transposons and plasmids
- Some exogenous genetic elements in GAS harbor virulence and antibiotic
  resistance genes.
- The prophage and ICEs have modular structures that are indicative of
  recombinational events.
- Experimentally, it can be demonstrated that ICEs transfer from one
  streptococcal donor species (e.g., _Streptococcus thermophilus_) and integrate
  into another recipient species (e.g., GAS) (Bellanger et al., 2009)
- Mobile genetic elements (MGEs)

Close Genetic Relatives of GAS
------------------------------
Human isolates of latexmath:[$\beta$]-hemolytic streptococci bearing group C or
G cell wall carbohydrate (GCS/GGS) are often classified as _S. dysgalactiae_
ssp. _equisimilis_. These organisms are common commensals of the upper
repiratory tract and are occasionally found in association with disease,
including invasive infections (Broyles et al., 2009). 

- _emm_ genes are very similar.

MLST data analysis provides evidence for genetic recombination between GCS/GGS 
and GAS (Ahmad et. al., 2009). 

Did the GCS/GGS human commensal organisms evolve from an ancestral GAS-like
pathogen, as observed for the close genetic relatives of the Mitis group? There
is evidence for the sharing of some virulence-related genes between GCS/GGS and
GAS (Kalia and Bessen, 2004; Towers et al., 2004; Bessen et al., 2005; Davies et
al., 2007).  Yet, certain virulence genes appear to have originated from one
species, whereas other virulence genes seem to have been transferred in the
opposite direction.  Some key GAS virulence factors (e.g., the secreted cysteine
proteinase SpeB) are absent from GCS/GGS.  

An important missing piece of the puzzle has been the complete genome sequence
for one or more strains of _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_, which has only
recently been released.  Perhaps with this added information, the evolution of
species within the pyogenic division can become better elucidated.

Rates of Gene Gain and Loss
---------------------------
Genetic flux in GAS was found to be dominated by gain and loss of prophage genes
(Didelot et al., 2009). 




Sentences
---------
Horizontal gene exchange followed by high rates of homologous recombination
among genes with relatively low levels of sequence divergence may have
contributed to the blurring boundaries (Fraser et al. 2007).

Models for the evolution of bacterial pathogens often invoke the acquisition of
virulence genes, followed by successful and rapid expansion of the pathogen
population.  The model for the evolution of the Mitis cluster is significant in
that it more strongly supports the opposite scenario, whereby commensals evolved
from a pathogen by a loss of virulence genes.

GCS/GGS and GAS colonize the same ecological niche and exhibit considerable
overlap in their disease profiles.
