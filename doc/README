Debra E. Bessen: Population Genetics of Streptococcus
-----------------------------------------------------
The following is based on the chapter 17 of Bacterial Population Genetics in
Infectious Disease.

About Streptococcus Genus
-------------------------
- Comprises more than 50 species,
- Inhabits hosts including humans and domesticated animals,
- Includes gram-positive bacteria,
- Undergoes extensive lateral gene transfer,

Streptococcus pyogenes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contains serogroups A carbohydrate,
- Group A Streptococcus, or GAS,
- Includes beta-hemolytic streptococci,
- Responsible for many cases of throat infection, pharyngitis and tonsillitis,
- Responsible for many cases of skin infection, nonbullous impetigo,

Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contains serogroups C, G, or L carbohydrate,
- Are often commensals, and are human pathogens,
- Are beta-hemolytic streptococci,

Streptococcus equi ssp. equi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contains serogroup C
- Are animal pathogens, infecting equine
- Are beta-hemolytic streptococci,

Streptococcus mutans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- alpha-hemolytic streptococci,
- major pathogen of dental caries in humans,
- Characterized by vertical transmission, from mother to infant,

Lancefield Method
-----------------
- Classfies gram-positive cocci,
- Serology-based typing approaches,

Virulence Genes of Streptococcus
--------------------------------

_emm_
~~~~~
- M Protein,

_sof_
~~~~~
- Lies upstream of the _emm_ gene,

FCT region
~~~~~~~~~~
- Lies 300kb away from the _emm_ region,

MLST
----
- Based on housekeeping genes,
- Tools used for population genetics study of a bacterial species,

Analysis Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- eBURST analysis (Feil et al., 2004) can infer the ancestor-descendant
  relationships between sequence types (ST),
- Empirical analysis of genetic change in single-locus variants (SLVs) (Feil et
  al., 2000),
- ClonalFrame uses a coalescent-based approach to estimate the relative
  probabilities that a nucleotide is changed as the result of homologous
  recombnation versus point muation (Didelot and Falush, 2007),
- Infinite allele model can estimate population recombination and mutation rates
  (Fraser et al., 2005; Hanage et al., 2006),
- Congruency of gene tree topologies can evaluate the relative extent of genetic
  diversification by recombination versus mutation by assessing congruence via
  pairwise comparisons of housekeeping gene tree topologies (Feil et al., 2001;
  see also Bessen, 2009),

Recombinations and Mutations
----------------------------
The high rates of recombination characterize most _Streptococcus_ species.
