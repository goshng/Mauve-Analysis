Abstract
--------
Group A streptococci (GAS) and group C/G streptococci (GCS/GGS) cohabit the same
ecological niche.  I investigate exchange of genetic elements between GAS and
GCS/GGS using their genomes.  The study shows that the two groups exchange genetic
segments across the entire genomes not just housekeeping genes.  
It shows that more genetic elements flowed overall
from GAS to GCS/GGS than the other direction.  
I find no evidence that virulence genes were exchanged more than other regions
of the genome. Three functional
categories show higher recombination rates: biosynthesis in fatty acid and
phospholipid metabolism, phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase
system (PTS) in signal transduction, and tRNA aminoacylation in protein fate.

Introduction
------------
Pathogenic bacteria infect many human diseases: e.g.,
food poisoning by _Eschericha Coli_,
strep throat by _Streptococcus pyrogenes_,
tuberculosis by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_,
cholera by _Vibrio cholera_,
anthrax by _Bacillus anthracis_,
pneumonia by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_, 
and influenza by _Haemophilus influenzae_, to name a few (a single CITE).
Among them,
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ belongs to group A streptococci (GAS)
that are a human-specific pathogen primarily infecting the throat and skin
(CITE). 
This human pathogen has high prevalence throughout the world
causing severe invasive streptococcal diseases:
pharyngitis also called strep throat, 
impetigo, 
cellulitis, 
necrotizing fasciitis,
toxic shock syndrome, 
acute rheumatic fever,
and acute glomerulonephritis (CITE). 
Its closely related species,
_Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_, belongs to group C or G
streptococci (GCS or GGS), once generally regarded as veterinary
pathogens (CITE).  Researchers have been confirming that GCS/GGS can
cause serious and life-threatening streptococcal diseases to human traditionally
associated with GAS (e.g., Brandt2009).  
Because _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ cohabits with _S. pyogenes_ 
at the same ecological niche of tissue sites,
they may as well exhibit overlap in the disease profile (Davies2007).
Therefore, genetic interaction between the two species may have played roles 
in formation of pathogenicity of _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_.
Understanding the genetic exchange could enhance our
knowledge of their pathogenic effect on human health.
Previously experimental research in gene exchange between the two pyogeneic species was
limited to relatively smaller portion of the bacterial genome, mostly focusing
on virulence genes (Kalia2004, Towers2004, Bessen2005). 
Davies2007 tackled a genome-wide profiling of virulence genes of the two
species using microarrays.
An earlier attempt at resolving the direction of gene flow between the two
species seemed unfortunately premature (see Kalia2001).
Yet, certain virulence genes appear to have originated from one
to another, and vice versa (Bessen2010).

Lateral gene transfer in bacteria is so prevalent, and lack of gene exchange
is considered unusual in bacterial evolution (Didelot2010b).   
Biological mechanisms that induce lateral gene transfer include
conjugation by plasmid, transduction by bacteriophages, and transformation of
naked DNA uptake (Thomas2005).   Transferred DNAs through the machanisms replace
their endogenous homologs, involving homologous recombination (CITE).   
Bacteria appear to benefit from recombination to acquire genetic material that
is selectively advantageous (Vos2009).  Although lateral gene transfer by
homologous recombination has
driven bacterial evolution, methodological development has hardly been able to
deal with properly the important evolutionary force.

Bacterial phylogenetic studies recognized early on that lateral gene transfer would
complicate analyses of evolutionary relationships of the species (e.g.,
Woese1987).  Methods of infferring phylogenies in the presence of laternal gene
transfer have been proposed (e.g., Bapteste2004, Simonson2005, Beiko2009).
Yet, most of the methods use relatively small portion of bacterial genomes, which 
is an unfortunate situation: 
As sequencing costs plummet (Mardis2011), bacterial genomes sequencing produces
genomes of high quality in many bacterial species (Tettelin2009).
Given high prevalence of laternal gene transfer via homologous recombination in
bacteria, values of complete bacterial genomes must not be understated (Fraser2002).  
Development of downstream analysis methods using bacterial genomes appears
to lag behind that of high-throughput sequencing technology (e.g., Green2011).

Didelot2010 developed a powerful statistical method, and implemented it
into a software called ClonalOrigin.  The method uses a reference species tree
inferred using bacterial genomes.  The reference species tree
serves as a back-bone where additional edges, hereafter I refer to as recombinant
edges, are attached to the species tree branches.  
A recombinant edge connects two branches of the reference
tree.  The authors describe that a recombinant edge 
``departs'' from an older time point at a species branch, 
and ``arrives'' at a more recent time point of another species branch.  
The arrival point corresponds to a recombination event
in an ancestral recombination graph (ARG).  
As the reference tree traverses a genome alignment to
meet a recombinant edge, its sister branch of the arrival point is erased and
the recombinant edge replaces it.
Consequently, gene trees change sequentially along a genome.  
This reminisces about gene conversion modeling by Wiuf1999, and the sequential
Markov coalescent due to McVean2005.
Although recombinant edges between two species branches do not denote gene flow
between two species in their original model, Didelot2010 exploited their method
to infer flow of genetic segment between _Bacillus cereus_ species.

Here I applied the method of ClonalOrigin to 
scrutinze intensity of gene flow between the two species of 
_S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ and _S. pyogenes_.
I hope that this study could be a step towards the understanding of interaction 
between the two closely related human pathogens. Specifically, I wish to answer 
to three questions. Firstly, did two species exchange genetic segments 
across the entire genome or parts of the genome?  What proportion of the genome
underwent higher recombination?  Secondly, if the two pyogenic
species exchanged genetic segments, was it overall unidirectional or bidirectional?
Thirdly, what classes of genes were exchanged if they exchanged genetic material? 
I organize the remainder of the paper as follows.  I describe the data set and its
analysis in Methods and Materials.  In Results, I provide evidence supporting my
answers to the questions of interest.  I end in Discussion.

Methods and Materials
---------------------
Briefly, a genome data set is described, which was also analyzed by
Suzuki2011.  The main procedure of using ClonalOrigin was described in 
Didelot2010.  A practical guide of the software could be found
at http://code.google.com/p/clonalorigin.  I also briefly described the
procedure, but I refer the users to Didelot2010 for further details.
Additionally, I summarized output of ClonalOrigin to answer to my specific
questions. 

ClonalOrigin pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two genomes of _S. pyogenes_, and one of _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_ 
were downloaded from GenBank with accessions: NC_004070 (Beres2002)
NC_008024 (Beres2006), and
NC_012891 (Shimomura2011).
Additional two genomes, each of _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_ 
and _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _dysgalactiae_ were provided by Suzuki2011
with accession identifiers of SdeqATCC12394 and SddyATCC27957, respectively. 
I refer the two genomes of NC_004070 and NC_008024
as SPY1 and SPY2, respectively. 
The two genomes of SdeqATCC12394 and NC_012891 are referred to as SDE1 and
SDE2, respectively. Finally, the genome of 
_S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _dysgalactiae_ is referred to as SDD.
The five genomes were first aligned using 
progressiveMauve (Darling2004, Darling2010)
with default options that had been 
released on November 11th 2009 with version 2.3.1 at
http://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/download.php.
I removed variable regions from the alignments to leave 
419 alignment blocks that were longer than 500 base pairs.
I excluded additional two alignment blocks because of too many gaps 
in their multiple alignments. Two more alignment blocks were excluded from a 
downstream analysis because 
the first stage of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with
ClonalOrigin was not finished within a month of computation.
This filtered the alignment blocks to leave 415 core alignment blocks.
ClonalFrame version 1.1 that was available at 
http://www.xavierdidelot.xtreemhost.com/clonalframe.htm
was applied to the 415 alignment blocks to estimate a clonal frame, or 
or a species tree of the five genomes (Didelot2007). 
Independent runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo were executed with a total
generation of chains being 20,000. 
The first 10,000 generations were discarded as burn-in. 
A few species trees were estimated, from which I chose one based on its
likelihood.

ClonalOrigin with a subversion r19 released on October 1st 2010 was downloaded
from http://clonalorigin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.
Two stages of MCMC with ClonalOrigin were used as described in Didelot2010.
The first one is used to 
obtain an estimate of population parameters such as mutation
rate, recombination rate, and recombinant tract length. 
The second stage of MCMC with ClonalOrigin was executed 
with the population parameters fixed to the estimated values in the previous
stage. This allowed to obtain a posterior sample of recombinant edges. 
Two independent runs of the first Markov chain Monte Carlo of ClonalOrigin were
executed with a total generation of each chain being 2,100,000. The first 1,100,000
generations of each chain were discarded as burn-in. The remaining 1,000,000
generations were subsampled every 10,000-th generation, leaving a posterior sample
of size 100. 
Additionally, Two independent
chains of the second ClonalOrigin Markov chain Montel Carlo were executed with a total
generation being 11,100,000. The first 1,100,000 generations of each chain were
discarded as burn-in. The remaining 10,000,000 generations were subsampled every
100,000 generations, leaving a sample of size 100. 

Recombinant edge count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A species tree in the ClonalOrigin framework can include recombinant edges, each
of which exists only over a smaller region of an alignment block.  A recombinant
edge departs at an older time of one of the species tree branches, and arrives
at an earlier time of another branch.  As a reference species tree starts from
one side to another along the alignment, and meets a recombinant edge, the
arrival branch of the species tree is detached and regrafted to the departure
branch. The species tree sequentially change along the alignment.  The number of
recombinant edges along all of the alignment blocks could indicate overall
recombination event intensity.  
Didelot2010 summarized the
number of recombination events inferred relative to its expected number under
the prior of the ClonalOrigin model given recombination rate for each pair of
donor and recipient branches.
Note that departure branches are donors, and arrival branches are recipients.
The observed number of recombination events for a donor/recipient pair is equal
to the inferred number of recombinant edges across all of the alignment blocks.
The prior expected number of recombination events given a global recombination
rate is approximated using Equation 7 in Didelot2010. Practically, the prior
expected number of recombination events was computed per block using
ClonalOrigin. 
The point estimate of the ratio was the average value of the ratio over all the
posterior sample.  The sample variable of the ratio was also computed over the
posterior sample.  I interpreted the ratio of recombination events for a given
donor/recipient pair as a measure of gene flow from a donor to a recipient species
tree branch.

Recombination intensity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overall recombination intensity, or measure of gene flow from a donor to a
recipient can be captured by
the observed number of recombination events relative to the prior expected
number of recombination events.  
Additionally, Didelot2010 provided another summary of
recombination events along a genome.  The summary measures the effect of donor
branches on a recipient species tree branch.  
Although the detailed procedure could be
different from that of Didelot2010, I used a similar approach to summarizing
recombination intensity along a genome, whic I describe as follows.

I measured how often a particular site along a genome is affected by
bacterial recombination.  A site of a block is affected by as many types of
recombinant edges as possible.  A type of recombinant edge is determined by the
departure and arrival branches of the reference species tree.  Sixty different
kinds of recombinant edges are possible in the species tree with five taxa.
Among the 60 types of recombinant edges 
32 pairs of branches are possible int an ultrametric species tree with
five taxa.  Not all types of the recombinant edges can correspond to legitimate
pairs of species tree branches for gene flow because some of branch pairs did
not exist at any past in time.  A recombinant edge can depart from a root edge
of a spcies tree and arrive at a leaf edge, and the recombinant edge cannot be
considered a channel that connect the two species tree branches.  I am
interested in gene flows 
between _S. pyogenes_ and _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_.  
Since they are at extant nodes,
pairs of species tree branches one from  _S. pyogenes_,
and another from _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_ can be
considered as gene flow channels.  Four ordered pairs of species branches
represent gene flow from _S. pyogenes_ to _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_.  
Another four ordered pairs represent gene flow 
from _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_ to _S. pyogenes_.

Functional categories under recombination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I used SPY1 genome for annotations.  The genbank formatted genome annotation was
downloaded from NCBI.  I downloaded JCVI role annotations of all JCVI annotated
genes at ftp://ftp.jcvi.org.  
I downloaded JCVI loci information of SPY1 genome at http://cmr.jcvi.org.  
I searched the JCVI CMV website for SPY1 genome to list JCVI loci. I compared
JCVI loci and NCBI locus_tag to find one-to-one association between JCVI
locus and NCCI locus_tag.  I downloaded bcp_go_role_link and bcp_role_link at
ftp://ftp.jcvi.org/pub/data/Omniome_Database/tab_delimited_omniome.
I used bcp_go_role_link to find gene ontology annotations for the JCVI loci.
The one-to-one associations were used to assign NCBI loci with their gene
ontology annotations and JCVI role annotations.
I listed roles at
http://cmr.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/CMR/shared/RoleList.cgi and parsed the HTML source
to find role categories and their identifiers.

For JCVI roles I can group locus tags by main roles or submain roles using the
numbers.  
I measured recombination intensity of a gene.  Recombination intensity of a gene
is an average weighted over the length of the gene in nucleotide.  
For each functional category of JCVI roles I divided genes into two groups where
one consists of genes with the corresponding functional category and another of
genes not annotated with the category.  Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were
performed for each functional category.
I also used the category of virulence genes from Davies2007 to test if virulence
genes were under higher or lower recombination. 

Results
-------

Core- and pan-genome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IMPORTANT: +Follow Darling2010 in the analysis of core- and pan-genome.+

The reference species tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Figure 1 shows the estimated species tree that relates the five streptococcal genomes.  
SPY1 and SPY2 form a clade while SDE1 and SDE2 form a separate clade. SDD is
connected to the lineage to the clade of SDE1 and SDE2.  
Mutation rate, $\theta$, was fixed to Watterson's estimate, or 106279.7. 
$\rho/\theta = 0.10$ with an interquartile range of (0.097,0.105) relative
mutation rate.  The average length $\delta = 370 bp$ with an interquartile range
of (355,384). $r/m = 4.7$ with an interquartile range of (4.5,4.9): more
substitutions are introduced by recombination than by mutation. 

Population parameter estimates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I applied the first stage of ClonalOrigin's MCMC to each of the alignment
blocks in order to estimate mutation rate, recombination rate, and recombination
tract length.  The median value for the recombination tract length $\delta$ was
1425 bp.  The median value for the per-site mutation rate $\theta_s/2$ was
0.0542.  The median value for the per-site recombination rate $\rho_s/2$ was
0.00521.  The median inferred value of $\rho/\theta$ was 0.096, which was
roughly equal to the corresponding value estimated by ClonalFrame. 
I proceeded to the second stage of ClonalOrigin's MCMC with values of $\delta$,
$\theta_s$, $\rho_s$ fixed to the estimated median values.

Genomic proportion under recombination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IMPORTANT: +Compute the proportion of sites along all of the alignment blocks where the
average number of recombinant edges per site is less than 1.+

IMPORTANT: +Recombination intensity per site is used to quantify proportion of the genome
alignment under weak recombination or strong recombination.+ 

Proportion of sites with recombinant edges less than 1 could indicate proportion of
the genome where local gene tree and global species tree are similar to each
other.   This threshold 1 is arbitrary.  


Directional gene flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Table 1 shows the observed number of recombinant edges relative to the prior
expected number of recombinant edges for each donor/recipient pair in the
species tree of the five genomes.  The ratios for the ordered pair from either
SPY1 or SPY2 to either SDE1 or SDE2 were 2.46, 2.48, 2.5, and 2.58.  The ratios
for the reverse direction were 1.16, 1.25, 1.47, and 1.59. The result appears to
indicate that gene flow from _Streptococcus pyogenes_ to
_S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_ was larger than that for the reverse
direction. 

IMPORTANT: +COMPUTE THE VARIANCE.+ 

I compared recombination intensity for the direction
from _Streptococcus pyogenes_ to
_S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_, and recombination intensity for the
reverse direction. 
Figure 3 shows the logarithm base 10 of the ratios for the genes
along SPY1 genome.  It indicates the overall unidirectional gene flow
from _Streptococcus pyogenes_ to _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_. 
It also indicates that the genes with unidirectional gene flow are uniformly
distributed across the SPY1 genome.

Function categories associated with higher recombination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IMPORTANT: +Draw the boxplots of recombination intensity for the functional
categories.+ 

Function categories show higher recombination rates: 
biosynthesis in fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, 
(p-value of 0.0001642)
phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in signal transduction, 
(p-value of 0.0002365)
tRNA aminoacylation in protein fate.
(p-value of 0.003271).


1. Total counts of events on average between species branches.
2. Import rate of a particular ordered pair of species branches along SPY1
genome.
3. Import rate of all ordered pairs of species branches along SPY1 genome.
4. Odd ratio of import rates to compare gene-flow-to-SDE and gene-flow-to-SPY
along SPY1 genome or SDE genome.

Species relationship among bacterial species of the _Streptococcus_ pyogenic
group is difficult because of higher recombination among them (Didelot2010).  
Bacterial genomes are the ultimate resources for resolving species tree of them.

Flow of genomic regions between _Streptococcus pyogenes_ and 
_S. dysgalactiae_ subspecies _equisimilis_ 
is investigated using five genomes including _S.
dysgalactiae_ spp. _dysgalactiae_.  Unidirectional flow of genomic regions
from _S. pyogenes_ to _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ is more prevalent
than the other direction.  
Two competing hypotheses on the evolution of the two species are tested.
I privide more evidence for hypothesis 1 with detailed view of evolutionary
history of the two Streptococci species.

Homologous recombination between bacterial species results in horizontal
transfer of genetic segments from a donor to a recipient species (CITE). 

have been conjectured to be the donor speices of 
in genetic loci including
housekeeping genes and virulence factors (CITE). Data analyses for testing the
hypothesis are limited by both very short regions of bacterial genomes and
unsatisfactory methods of statistical inference (CITE). 
Tens of GAS genomes are publically available (e.g., CITE of one GAS genome), and
two genomes for _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ (SDE) that is GCS or GGS
are also recently available (CITE of each of the two genomes).
Despite the surge of bacterial genomic data, development of methods for
analyzing those data lags behind. Recently, Didelot2010 pioneered to exploit
bacterial genomes in an effort to better understand homologous recombination
between bacterial species and strains.
I take the advantage of the powerful statistical method to investigate
horizontal transfer of genetic segments between _S. pyogenes_ and 
_S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_.  I provide evidence supporting that SDE
imported genetic segments from _S. pyogenes_ via homologous recombination.

Genomic content flow

Lack of analyses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only two genomes of _S. pyogenes_ were used.
Only two genomes of _S. dysgalactiae_ subspecies _equisimilis_ were used.
Analyses with more isolates could potentially reveal congruent relationships
between virulence profiles and GCS/GGS disease propensity.

I did not account for gene gain and loss in the analysis. Only well aligned
regions were used in the analysis.


Delorme:2007 indicated that _S. salivarius_ and _S. vestibularis_ may have
evolutionary history that is parallel to _SDE_ and _S. pyogenes_.

Virulence factors associated with disease
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What virulence factors?
[Davies2007] studied 216 GAS virulence genes, not other genes
to profile the virulence gene repertoires of many (or 58) 
_Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ isolates recovered during human
infections.

Look at the file, doc/virulence-genes.txt, for virulence genes.

What is disease propensity?

A Question of interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ had been known to infect
domesticated animals (CITEs).
Recently, reports that _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ (SDE) were recovered as
human pathogens just like _S. pyogenes_ (SPY) are increasing (CITEs).  
Although SDE and
SPY form distinct genotypic contents, pathogenic phenotypes of the two species
manifest similarly (CITEs).
How did SDE evolve? Did it evolve from an ancestral form of pathogenic bateria?
Did it evolve from a commensal bacteria? Did genetic elements transfer from
SPY's lineage to SDE's? Or, were there cases of the opposite direction of gene
flow? In this study, I want to catalogue genetic elements according to their
pattern of flow in the evolutionary history that relates SPY and SDE. 

Scenarios of evolution of SPY and SDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. The most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is a GAS-like pathogen. SDE
was losing virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor. SDE regains
virulence factors from SPY because of the same niche.
2. The most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is a GGS/GCS-like commensal.
SPY evolves virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor. SDE gains
virulence factors from SPY.

- Based on housekeeping genes,
- Tools used for population genetics study of a bacterial species,

Analysis Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- eBURST analysis (Feil et al., 2004) can infer the ancestor-descendant
  relationships between sequence types (ST),
- Empirical analysis of genetic change in single-locus variants (SLVs) (Feil et
  al., 2000),
- ClonalFrame uses a coalescent-based approach to estimate the relative
  probabilities that a nucleotide is changed as the result of homologous
  recombnation versus point muation (Didelot and Falush, 2007),
- Infinite allele model can estimate population recombination and mutation rates
  (Fraser et al., 2005; Hanage et al., 2006),
- Congruency of gene tree topologies can evaluate the relative extent of genetic
  diversification by recombination versus mutation by assessing congruence via
  pairwise comparisons of housekeeping gene tree topologies (Feil et al., 2001;
  see also Bessen, 2009),

Recombinations and Mutations
----------------------------
The high rates of recombination characterize most _Streptococcus_ species.


Streptococcus Genomes Available
-------------------------------
- pneumococci (Tettelin et al., 2001)
- GAS (Ferretti et al., 2001)
- GBS (Tettelin et al., 2002)
- _S. equi_
- _S. zooepidemicus_
- _S. gordonii_
- _S. mutans_
- _S. mitis_
- _S. suis_
- _S. uberis_
The _Streptococcus_ genomes range in size from ~1.7 to 2.2 Mb.

Genomic Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exogenous genetic elements
- prophages
- integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs)
- conjugative transposons and plasmids
- Some exogenous genetic elements in GAS harbor virulence and antibiotic
  resistance genes.
- The prophage and ICEs have modular structures that are indicative of
  recombinational events.
- Experimentally, it can be demonstrated that ICEs transfer from one
  streptococcal donor species (e.g., _Streptococcus thermophilus_) and integrate
  into another recipient species (e.g., GAS) (Bellanger et al., 2009)
- Mobile genetic elements (MGEs)

Close Genetic Relatives of GAS
------------------------------
Human isolates of latexmath:[$\beta$]-hemolytic streptococci bearing group C or
G cell wall carbohydrate (GCS/GGS) are often classified as _S. dysgalactiae_
ssp. _equisimilis_. These organisms are common commensals of the upper
repiratory tract and are occasionally found in association with disease,
including invasive infections (Broyles et al., 2009). 

- _emm_ genes are very similar.

MLST data analysis provides evidence for genetic recombination between GCS/GGS 
and GAS (Ahmad et. al., 2009). 

Did the GCS/GGS human commensal organisms evolve from an ancestral GAS-like
pathogen, as observed for the close genetic relatives of the Mitis group? 
There
is evidence for the sharing of some virulence-related genes between GCS/GGS and
GAS (Kalia and Bessen, 2004; Towers et al., 2004; Bessen et al., 2005; Davies et
al., 2007).  Yet, certain virulence genes appear to have originated from one
species, whereas other virulence genes seem to have been transferred in the
opposite direction.  Some key GAS virulence factors (e.g., the secreted cysteine
proteinase SpeB) are absent from GCS/GGS.  

An important missing piece of the puzzle has been the complete genome sequence
for one or more strains of _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_, which has only
recently been released.  Perhaps with this added information, the evolution of
species within the pyogenic division can become better elucidated.

Rates of Gene Gain and Loss
---------------------------
Genetic flux in GAS was found to be dominated by gain and loss of prophage genes
(Didelot et al., 2009). 




Sentences
---------
Horizontal gene exchange followed by high rates of homologous recombination
among genes with relatively low levels of sequence divergence may have
contributed to the blurring boundaries (Fraser et al. 2007).

Models for the evolution of bacterial pathogens often invoke the acquisition of
virulence genes, followed by successful and rapid expansion of the pathogen
population.  The model for the evolution of the Mitis cluster is significant in
that it more strongly supports the opposite scenario, whereby commensals evolved
from a pathogen by a loss of virulence genes.

GCS/GGS and GAS colonize the same ecological niche and exhibit considerable
overlap in their disease profiles.

Kalia:2004
~~~~~~~~~~
The molecular mechanisms underlying niche adaptation in bacteria are not fully
understood.

The emm genes encode M surface proteins, which display extensive heterogeneity
in terms of structure and function.

More recently, multilocus sequence typing revealed that horizontal acquisition
may also have contributed to variations in selection-neutral housekeeping genes
in GGS.  The multilocus sequence typing data also suggests that the overall
direction of genetic flow is predominantly from GAS to GGS. -- cited by Twoers:2004

Towers:2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
We report evidence of interspecies gene transfer between the important virulence
factor genes sfbI and gfbA.
Because the identified group G streptococcus gfbA types possess DNA cassettes
that can be identified in a number of group A streptococcus strains, it appears
that homologous recombination is occurring between these species.

Bessen:2005
~~~~~~~~~~~
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ is a highly prevalent bacterial pathogen, most often
giving rise to superficial infections at the throat or skin of its human host.

The findings provide strong support for a mechanism underlying niche
specialization that involves orthologous replacement of regulatory genes follow-
ing interspecies horizontal transfer, although the directionality of gene
exchange remains unknown.

In contrast to the strong linkage observed between emm pattern and tissue site
of isolation, the distribution of neutral housekeeping alleles among strains of
_S. pyogenes_ is highly random.

_S. pyogenes_ ranks among the most highly recombinogenic of several bacterial
species examined (19), whereby genetic recombination is the consequence of a
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event. (I think that HGT is the result of genetic
recombination, isn't it?)

Orthologous gene replacements leading to the successful exploitation of a new
niche may have a particularly high impact on the accelerated evolution of this
bacterial species, which is otherwise lacking in pathogenicity islands (55). (I
think that _S. pyogenes_ lacks in pathogenicity islands (PAI).)

Schmidt:2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
The genome sequence of S. pyogenes revealed that a large number of virulence
factors have been acquired by bacteriophage-mediated horizontal gene transfer
but that PAI are absent from the genome (90). In contrast, a chromosomal region
reminiscent of a PAI has been identified in S. pneumoniae. This locus was termed
pneumo- coccal pathogenicity island 1 (PPI-1) (34).

Good wordings
-------------
. It is postulated that ...
. The studies described in this report are part of a multidisciplinary effort to better understand ...
. ... consistent with the observation that ...
. Two bacteria have a common disease spectrum.

Why is recombination rate between SPY1 and SPY2 lower than that between SPY and SDE?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is because Clonal Origin cannot detect recombination between SPY1 and SPY2.
It can easily detect recombination between SPY and SDE. Recombinations are
common events between strains with a species, e.g., SPY. Clonal Origin cannot
detect those.

Questions
---------
. See if _sbfI_ and _gfbA_ are under high recombination. Towers:2004 found
evidence that suports horizontal transfer from _S. pyogenes_ to SDE.
. Bessen:2005 found evidence that supports horizontal transfer of _mga_ and
_rofA/nra_ genes between _S. pyogenes_ and SDE. But, they could not find
evidence for the direction of the flow.
. Beesen:2005 suggested that _rofCG_ may have been transferred from SDE to 
_S. pyogenes_.
. Bessen:2005 suggested that _rofA_ and _ska-2a_ may have been transferred from
SDE to _S. pyogenes_. This might facilitate the adaptation of some clones of 
_S. pyogenes_ to the throat, a new niche.
. Correlation between genomic location and recombination rates exits. Unless
there are correlations between functional categories and genomic locations I'd
not expect correlation between recombination and function classes.

Bacteria evolve vertically and horizontally. 
Clonal evolution of bacteria allows us to trace their history via species
trees. 
Homologous recombination among 
closely related species and gene transfer between distantly related
species shape the diversity of bacterial speices.  The diversification of
bacterial species via horizontal gene flow make inferring species trees
a formidable statistical problem.  Researchers tend to abandon evolutionary
models of bifurcating tree, and embrace web-like network models. Web-like
network models are difficult to interpret.
Species boundaries among bacterial
species formed horizontally are blurred.
Bacterial conjugation, transformation, and transduction induce homologous
recombinations that are biological mechanisms through which 
a donor bacterium gives a recipient bacterium genetic segments. 
Inferring recombination events between bacterial species would facilitate
understanding of gene flow from a bacterial species to another.
 
High-throughput genotyping efforts of many bacterial species are underway.
Methodological developments keep pace with the endeavor. Notably, 


For gene ontologies I should be able to test if a gene ontology
category of a locus tag belongs to a main gene ontology category; say
metabolism
within a cellular process.  There is a slim gene ontology as far as I know.  The
slim gene ontology should contain most gene ontology categories and it can be
used to test a gene ontology category's membership in the gene ontology.
There must be a PERL script to test that. Let me find the PERL script and the slim
gene ontology file. Note that one locus tag can belong to multiple
functional
categories.
