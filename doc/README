Abstract
--------
Flow of genomic regions between _Streptococcus pyogenes_ and 
_S. dysgalactiae_ subspecies _equisimilis_ 
is investigated using five genomes including _S.
dysgalactiae_ spp. _dysgalactiae_.  Unidirectional flow of genomic regions
from _S. pyogenes_ to _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ is more prevalent
than the other direction.  
Two competing hypotheses on the evolution of the two species are tested.
I privide more evidence for hypothesis 1 with detailed view of evolutionary
history of the two Streptococci species.

Homologous recombination between bacterial species results in horizontal
transfer of genetic segments from a donor to a recipient species (CITE). Group A
streptococci (GAS) have been conjectured to be the donor speices of group C and
G streptococci (GCS and GGS, respectively) in genetic loci including
housekeeping genes and virulence factors (CITE). Data analyses for testing the
hypothesis are limited by both very short regions of bacterial genomes and
unsatisfactory methods of statistical inference (CITE). 
Tens of GAS genomes are publically available (e.g., CITE of one GAS genome), and
two genomes for _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ (SDE) that is GCS or GGS
are also recently available (CITE of each of the two genomes).
Despite the surge of bacterial genomic data, development of methods for
analyzing those data lags behind. Recently, Didelot:2010 pioneered to exploit
bacterial genomes in an effort to better understand homologous recombination
between bacterial species and strains.
I take the advantage of the powerful statistical method to investigate
horizontal transfer of genetic segments between _S. pyogenes_ and 
_S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_.  I provide evidence supporting that SDE
imported genetic segments from _S. pyogenes_ via homologous recombination.

Introduction
------------

GAS
~~~
. Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a human-specific pathogen primarily infecting the
throat and skin.
. S. pyogenes can cause severe invasive disease.
. Streptococcus pyogenes is a human pathogen having high prevalence throughout
the world.


GGS
~~~
. Group G streptococcus (GGS) is generally regarded as a less important organism,
which cohabits with GAS at the same tissue sites.
. Some GGS, specifically Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equi- similis, are
capable of causing serious and life-threatening dis- eases traditionally
associated with GAS.

GCS/GGS and GAS colonize the same ecological niche
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where?

GCS/GGS and GAS exhibit overlap in their disease profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What disease profiles?

Virulence factors associated with disease
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What virulence factors?
[Davies2007] studied 216 GAS virulence genes, not other genes
to profile the virulence gene repertoires of many (or 58) 
_Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ isolates recovered during human
infections.

What is disease propensity?

A Question of interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ had been known to infect
domesticated animals (CITEs).
Recently, reports that _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ (SDE) were recovered as
human pathogens just like _S. pyogenes_ (SPY) are increasing (CITEs).  
Although SDE and
SPY form distinct genotypic contents, pathogenic phenotypes of the two species
manifest similarly (CITEs).
How did SDE evolve? Did it evolve from an ancestral form of pathogenic bateria?
Did it evolve from a commensal bacteria? Did genetic elements transfer from
SPY's lineage to SDE's? Or, were there cases of the opposite direction of gene
flow? In this study, I want to catalogue genetic elements according to their
pattern of flow in the evolutionary history that relates SPY and SDE. 

Scenarios of evolution of SPY and SDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. The most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is a GAS-like pathogen. SDE
was losing virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor. SDE regains
virulence factors from SPY because of the same niche.
2. The most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is a GGS/GCS-like commensal.
SPY evolves virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor. SDE gains
virulence factors from SPY.



Methods and Materials
---------------------

Bacterial genomes from NCBI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I use two genomes of _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_, two genomes of 
_Streptococcus pyogenes_, and one genome of _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _dysgalactiae_.
Two genomes of _S. pyogenes_ were downloaded from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes: 
Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS315_uid57911/NC_004070.gbk [Beres2002]
and 
Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS10750_uid58575/NC_008024.gbk [Beres2006].
A genome Genbank file of _S. dysgalactiae_ spp. _equisimilis_ was found at 
Streptococcus_dysgalactiae_equisimilis_GGS_124_uid59103/NC_012891.gbk.
Two more genomes were provided by (CITEs):
cornell_sde1/SdeqATCC12394.gbk 
and
cornell_sdd/SddyATCC27957.gbk.
I refer the two genomes of MGAS315 and MGAS1075 as SPY1 and SPY2, respectively. 
The two genomes of SdeqATCC12394.gbk and GGS_124 are referred to as SDE1 and
SDE2, respectively. The genome of Genbank file SddyATCC27957.gbk is called SDD.

I followed the tutorial provided at
http://code.google.com/p/clonalorigin.

Genome alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I downloaded progressiveMauve version 2.3.1, released on November 11th 2009 from 
http://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/download.php.
Default options were used to align the five _Streptococcus_ genomes. 
I removed variable regions from the alignment to leave 
419 alignment blocks that are longer than 500 base pair.

ClonalFrame
~~~~~~~~~~~
I downloaded ClonalFrame version 1.1 at
http://www.xavierdidelot.xtreemhost.com/clonalframe.htm.
I applied ClonalFrame to the 419 core alignment blocks to obtain a clonal frame,
or a species tree of the five species.
Three independent runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo were executed with a total
generation of chains being 20,000. The first 10,000 generations were discarded
as burn-in. 

ClonalOrigin
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I downloaded a subversion r19 of ClonalOrigin, released on October 1st 2010 from
http://clonalorigin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.
Two independent runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo chain with ClonalOrigin were
made with a total generation of each chain being 2,100,000. The first 1,100,000
generations of each chain were discarded as burn-in. The remaining 1,000,000
generations were subsampled every 10,000 generations, leaving a posterior sample
of size 100. I obtained an estimate of population parameters such as mutation
rate, recombination rate, and recombinant tract length. 
A second stage of Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure was executed with
ClonalOrigin by fixing the population parameters to the estimated values. This
allowed to obtain a posterior sample of recombinant edges. Two independent
chains of Markov chain Montel Carlo with ClonalOrigin were executed with a total
generation being 11,100,000. The first 1,100,000 generations of each chain were
discarded as burn-in. The remaining 10,000,000 generations were subsampled every
100,000 generations, leaving a sample of size 100.

Bacterial genome annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MGAS315 (NC_004070.gbk) or other _S. pyogenes_ genomes might have genome
annotations. 

How do I know functional categories of genes?
No citations were made in [Davies2007] about the categorization. 
A block can contain multiple genes.
I think that I need to know how I can categorize genetic elements of MGAS315
genome.

Summary of gene flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I want to develop scripts to summarize gene flow of a genomic segment given a
speices tree. A genomic segment includes protein-coding genes or non-coding
elements.
I like Figures 2, 5, and 7 of Didelot's ClonalOrigin paper. For
each site or a window of a contiguous segment, a figure just like Figure 5 can
be depicted. As I scan through a genomic segment by site or window, dynamic
changes to the figure similiar to Figure 5 would show fluctuation of gene flow
of the genomic segment.
How can I summarize gene flows properly from a posterior sample of recombinant
edges?
Or, I could use figures such as Figures 2 and 7 to describe results
qualitatively. I may have to do this.



Discussion
----------

Lack of analyses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only two genomes of _S. pyogenes_ were used.
Only two genomes of _S. dysgalactiae_ subspecies _equisimilis_ were used.
Analyses with more isolates could potentially reveal congruent relationships
between virulence profiles and GCS/GGS disease propensity.

I did not account for gene gain and loss in the analysis. Only well aligned
regions were used in the analysis.


Discussion
----------

Delorme:2007 indicated that _S. salivarius_ and _S. vestibularis_ may have
evolutionary history that is parallel to _SDE_ and _S. pyogenes_.

Recombinations and Mutations
----------------------------
The high rates of recombination characterize most _Streptococcus_ species.


Streptococcus Genomes Available
-------------------------------
- pneumococci (Tettelin et al., 2001)
- GAS (Ferretti et al., 2001)
- GBS (Tettelin et al., 2002)
- _S. equi_
- _S. zooepidemicus_
- _S. gordonii_
- _S. mutans_
- _S. mitis_
- _S. suis_
- _S. uberis_
The _Streptococcus_ genomes range in size from ~1.7 to 2.2 Mb.

Genomic Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exogenous genetic elements
- prophages
- integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs)
- conjugative transposons and plasmids
- Some exogenous genetic elements in GAS harbor virulence and antibiotic
  resistance genes.
- The prophage and ICEs have modular structures that are indicative of
  recombinational events.
- Experimentally, it can be demonstrated that ICEs transfer from one
  streptococcal donor species (e.g., _Streptococcus thermophilus_) and integrate
  into another recipient species (e.g., GAS) (Bellanger et al., 2009)
- Mobile genetic elements (MGEs)

Close Genetic Relatives of GAS
------------------------------
Human isolates of latexmath:[$\beta$]-hemolytic streptococci bearing group C or
G cell wall carbohydrate (GCS/GGS) are often classified as _S. dysgalactiae_
ssp. _equisimilis_. These organisms are common commensals of the upper
repiratory tract and are occasionally found in association with disease,
including invasive infections (Broyles et al., 2009). 

- _emm_ genes are very similar.

MLST data analysis provides evidence for genetic recombination between GCS/GGS 
and GAS (Ahmad et. al., 2009). 

Did the GCS/GGS human commensal organisms evolve from an ancestral GAS-like
pathogen, as observed for the close genetic relatives of the Mitis group? There
is evidence for the sharing of some virulence-related genes between GCS/GGS and
GAS (Kalia and Bessen, 2004; Towers et al., 2004; Bessen et al., 2005; Davies et
al., 2007).  Yet, certain virulence genes appear to have originated from one
species, whereas other virulence genes seem to have been transferred in the
opposite direction.  Some key GAS virulence factors (e.g., the secreted cysteine
proteinase SpeB) are absent from GCS/GGS.  

An important missing piece of the puzzle has been the complete genome sequence
for one or more strains of _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_, which has only
recently been released.  Perhaps with this added information, the evolution of
species within the pyogenic division can become better elucidated.

Rates of Gene Gain and Loss
---------------------------
Genetic flux in GAS was found to be dominated by gain and loss of prophage genes
(Didelot et al., 2009). 




Sentences
---------
Horizontal gene exchange followed by high rates of homologous recombination
among genes with relatively low levels of sequence divergence may have
contributed to the blurring boundaries (Fraser et al. 2007).

Models for the evolution of bacterial pathogens often invoke the acquisition of
virulence genes, followed by successful and rapid expansion of the pathogen
population.  The model for the evolution of the Mitis cluster is significant in
that it more strongly supports the opposite scenario, whereby commensals evolved
from a pathogen by a loss of virulence genes.

GCS/GGS and GAS colonize the same ecological niche and exhibit considerable
overlap in their disease profiles.

Kalia:2004
^^^^^^^^^^
The molecular mechanisms underlying niche adaptation in bacteria are not fully
understood.

The emm genes encode M surface proteins, which display extensive heterogeneity
in terms of structure and function.

More recently, multilocus sequence typing revealed that horizontal acquisition
may also have contributed to variations in selection-neutral housekeeping genes
in GGS.  The multilocus sequence typing data also suggests that the overall
direction of genetic flow is predominantly from GAS to GGS. -- cited by Twoers:2004

Towers:2004
^^^^^^^^^^^
We report evidence of interspecies gene transfer between the important virulence
factor genes sfbI and gfbA.
Because the identified group G streptococcus gfbA types possess DNA cassettes
that can be identified in a number of group A streptococcus strains, it appears
that homologous recombination is occurring between these species.

Bessen:2005
^^^^^^^^^^^
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ is a highly prevalent bacterial pathogen, most often
giving rise to superficial infections at the throat or skin of its human host.

The findings provide strong support for a mechanism underlying niche
specialization that involves orthologous replacement of regulatory genes follow-
ing interspecies horizontal transfer, although the directionality of gene
exchange remains unknown.

In contrast to the strong linkage observed between emm pattern and tissue site
of isolation, the distribution of neutral housekeeping alleles among strains of
S. pyogenes is highly random.

S. pyogenes ranks among the most highly recom- binogenic of several bacterial
species examined (19), whereby genetic recombination is the consequence of a
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event. (I think that HGT is the result of genetic
recombination, isn't it?)

Orthologous gene replacements leading to the successful exploitation of a new
niche may have a particularly high impact on the accelerated evolution of this
bacterial species, which is otherwise lacking in pathogenicity islands (55). (I
think that _S. pyogenes_ lacks in pathogenicity islands (PAI).)

Schmidt:2004
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The genome sequence of S. pyogenes revealed that a large number of virulence
factors have been acquired by bacteriophage-mediated horizontal gene transfer
but that PAI are absent from the genome (90). In contrast, a chromosomal region
reminiscent of a PAI has been identified in S. pneumoniae. This locus was termed
pneumo- coccal pathogenicity island 1 (PPI-1) (34).

Good wordings
-------------
. It is postulated that ...
. The studies described in this report are part of a multidisciplinary effort to better understand ...
. ... consistent with the observation that ...
. Two bacteria have a common disease spectrum.

Why is recombination rate between SPY1 and SPY2 lower than that between SPY and SDE?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is because Clonal Origin cannot detect recombination between SPY1 and SPY2.
It can easily detect recombination between SPY and SDE. Recombinations are
common events between strains with a species, e.g., SPY. Clonal Origin cannot
detect those.

Questions
---------
. See if _sbfI_ and _gfbA_ are under high recombination. Towers:2004 found
evidence that suports horizontal transfer from _S. pyogenes_ to SDE.
. Bessen:2005 found evidence that supports horizontal transfer of _mga_ and
_rofA/nra_ genes between _S. pyogenes_ and SDE. But, they could not find
evidence for the direction of the flow.
. Beesen:2005 suggested that _rofCG_ may have been transferred from SDE to 
_S. pyogenes_.
. Bessen:2005 suggested that _rofA_ and _ska-2a_ may have been transferred from
SDE to _S. pyogenes_. This might facilitate the adaptation of some clones of 
_S. pyogenes_ to the throat, a new niche.
. Correlation between genomic location and recombination rates exits. Unless
there are correlations between functional categories and genomic locations I'd
not expect correlation between recombination and function classes.
