Debra E. Bessen: Population Genetics of Streptococcus
-----------------------------------------------------
The following is based on the chapter 17 of Bacterial Population Genetics in
Infectious Disease.

About Streptococcus Genus
-------------------------
- Comprises more than 50 species,
- Inhabits hosts including humans and domesticated animals,
- Includes gram-positive bacteria,
- Undergoes extensive lateral gene transfer,

Streptococcus pyogenes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contains serogroups A carbohydrate,
- Group A Streptococcus, or GAS,
- Includes beta-hemolytic streptococci,
- Responsible for many cases of throat infection, pharyngitis and tonsillitis,
- Responsible for many cases of skin infection, nonbullous impetigo,

Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contains serogroups C, G, or L carbohydrate,
- Are often commensals, and are human pathogens,
- Are beta-hemolytic streptococci,

Streptococcus equi ssp. equi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contains serogroup C
- Are animal pathogens, infecting equine
- Are beta-hemolytic streptococci,

Streptococcus mutans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- alpha-hemolytic streptococci,
- major pathogen of dental caries in humans,
- Characterized by vertical transmission, from mother to infant,

Lancefield Method
-----------------
- Classfies gram-positive cocci,
- Serology-based typing approaches,

Virulence Genes of Streptococcus
--------------------------------

_emm_
~~~~~
- M Protein,

_sof_
~~~~~
- Lies upstream of the _emm_ gene,

_mga_
~~~~~

FCT region
~~~~~~~~~~
- Lies 300kb away from the _emm_ region,

MLST
----
- Based on housekeeping genes,
- Tools used for population genetics study of a bacterial species,

Analysis Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- eBURST analysis (Feil et al., 2004) can infer the ancestor-descendant
  relationships between sequence types (ST),
- Empirical analysis of genetic change in single-locus variants (SLVs) (Feil et
  al., 2000),
- ClonalFrame uses a coalescent-based approach to estimate the relative
  probabilities that a nucleotide is changed as the result of homologous
  recombnation versus point muation (Didelot and Falush, 2007),
- Infinite allele model can estimate population recombination and mutation rates
  (Fraser et al., 2005; Hanage et al., 2006),
- Congruency of gene tree topologies can evaluate the relative extent of genetic
  diversification by recombination versus mutation by assessing congruence via
  pairwise comparisons of housekeeping gene tree topologies (Feil et al., 2001;
  see also Bessen, 2009),

Recombinations and Mutations
----------------------------
The high rates of recombination characterize most _Streptococcus_ species.


Streptococcus Genomes Available
-------------------------------
- pneumococci (Tettelin et al., 2001)
- GAS (Ferretti et al., 2001)
- GBS (Tettelin et al., 2002)
- _S. equi_
- _S. zooepidemicus_
- _S. gordonii_
- _S. mutans_
- _S. mitis_
- _S. suis_
- _S. uberis_
The _Streptococcus_ genomes range in size from ~1.7 to 2.2 Mb.

Genomic Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exogenous genetic elements
- prophages
- integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs)
- conjugative transposons and plasmids
- Some exogenous genetic elements in GAS harbor virulence and antibiotic
  resistance genes.
- The prophage and ICEs have modular structures that are indicative of
  recombinational events.
- Experimentally, it can be demonstrated that ICEs transfer from one
  streptococcal donor species (e.g., _Streptococcus thermophilus_) and integrate
  into another recipient species (e.g., GAS) (Bellanger et al., 2009)
- Mobile genetic elements (MGEs)

Close Genetic Relatives of GAS
------------------------------
Human isolates of latexmath:[$\beta$]-hemolytic streptococci bearing group C or
G cell wall carbohydrate (GCS/GGS) are often classified as _S. dysgalactiae_
ssp. _equisimilis_. These organisms are common commensals of the upper
repiratory tract and are occasionally found in association with disease,
including invasive infections (Broyles et al., 2009). 

- _emm_ genes are very similar.

MLST data analysis provides evidence for genetic recombination between GCS/GGS 
and GAS (Ahmad et. al., 2009). 

Did the GCS/GGS human commensal organisms evolve from an ancestral GAS-like
pathogen, as observed for the close genetic relatives of the Mitis group? There
is evidence for the sharing of some virulence-related genes between GCS/GGS and
GAS (Kalia and Bessen, 2004; Towers et al., 2004; Bessen et al., 2005; Davies et
al., 2007).  Yet, certain virulence genes appear to have originated from one
species, whereas other virulence genes seem to have been transferred in the
opposite direction.  Some key GAS virulence factors (e.g., the secreted cysteine
proteinase SpeB) are absent from GCS/GGS.  

An important missing piece of the puzzle has been the complete genome sequence
for one or more strains of _S. dysgalactiae_ ssp. _equisimilis_, which has only
recently been released.  Perhaps with this added information, the evolution of
species within the pyogenic division can become better elucidated.

Rates of Gene Gain and Loss
---------------------------
Genetic flux in GAS was found to be dominated by gain and loss of prophage genes
(Didelot et al., 2009). 




Sentences
---------
Horizontal gene exchange followed by high rates of homologous recombination
among genes with relatively low levels of sequence divergence may have
contributed to the blurring boundaries (Fraser et al. 2007).

Models for the evolution of bacterial pathogens often invoke the acquisition of
virulence genes, followed by successful and rapid expansion of the pathogen
population.  The model for the evolution of the Mitis cluster is significant in
that it more strongly supports the opposite scenario, whereby commensals evolved
from a pathogen by a loss of virulence genes.
