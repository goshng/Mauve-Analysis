 (SDE) were interrogated using two recently developed methods that used
 whole genomes of the two species.
 One of the methods used core genomes of multiple DNA sequence alignments
 with few gaps, and the other used pan genomes of alignments where multiple
 paralogs could also be aligned and some of species did not have DNA sequences
 aligned.
 The two combined methods allowed to examine what kinds of genes or their
 fragments were exchanges between SPY and SDE in order to find their roles
 in the formation of pathogenicity of SDE.
 SPY is a pervasive human-specific pathogen which causes streptococcal diseases.
 A closely related species SDE has long been thought of as a veterinary
 pathogen, but evidence has emerged that it can cause serious and life-threateni
ng human diseases traditionally associated with SPY.
 Previous studies were limited to relatively small portion of SPY and SDE
 genomes partly because of lack of methods for studying gene transfer due
 to bacterial recombination and 
\emph on
de novo
\emph default
 integration on the genome scale, and partly due to unavailability of relevant
 bacterial genomes.
 Using the core genomes we revisited a problem of the overall directionality
 of gene transfer between SPY and SDE, and found marginally supporting evidence
 for relative genomic flow from SPY to SDE based on bacterial recombination
 as surrogate measure of genomic flow.
 Protein coding genes that appeared to undergo gene transfer due to bacterial
 recombination were found to be in several kinds of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase
 (aaRS), phosphotransferase systems (PTS) specific to each of several sugars,
 and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.
 The association of aaRS with gene transfer was relatively well known, which
 confirmed the power of the method of using the core genomes.
 The PTS and ABC transporters could be essential for the successful adaptation
 of the bacteria in new environments, which could be related with pathogenicity
 of SDE.
 Using the pan genomes the second method of reconciliation of species tree
 and gene trees based on gene fragments provided evidence that virulence
 genes appeared to undergo horizontal gene transfer than non-virulence genes.
 On the contrary, the first method of using the core genomes did not find
 association with virulence genes.
 This might indicate that additional genes obtained via horizontal gene
 transfer were more effective than gene fragments transfer via bacterial
 recombination for pathogenic bacteria or SDE to acquire biological functions
 that were critical to their survival in the environment in which their
 close relatives or SPY thrived.

 Because SDE cohabits with SPY at the same ecological niche of tissue sites,
 they may as well exhibit overlap in the disease profile

 The close proximity may allow the two species to interact with each other

 Pathogenicity of SDE may have been facilitated by the genetic interaction
 between the two species.
 Understanding their genetic exchanges would enhance our knowledge of mechanisms
 of their pathogenicity on human health.

Two distinguished mechanisms of bacterial gene transfer:
\series default
 Bacteria evolve vertically and horizontally.
 Vertically, bacteria evolve clonally: parents pass their genetic contents
 down to their daughter cells.
 Mutations during the vertical evolution accumulate, which allows bacterial
 species to diverge in their genomic contents.
 Horizontally, bacteria obtain parts of genomes from others via conjugation
 by plasmid, transduction by bacteriophages, or transformation of naked
 DNA uptake

 The former process involves bacterial recombination, and the latter horizontal
 transfer of DNA fragments.
 We wish to ditinguish gene transfer due to bacterial homologous recombination
 from integration of gene fragments to a recipient bacterium due to horizontal
 gene transfer.
 Note that we discriminate between the two processes throughout the manuscript
 although both of the processes result in gene transfer from a donor to
 a recipient.

 developed a powerful statistical method, and implemented it into a software
 called ClonalOrigin.
 The method uses a reference species tree inferred using bacterial genomes.
 The reference species tree serves as a back-bone where additional edges,
 hereafter referred to as recombinant edges, are attached to the species
 tree branches.
 A recombinant edge connects two branches of the reference tree.
 The authors describe that a recombinant edge ``departs'' from an older
 time point at a species branch, and ``arrives'' at a more recent time point
 of another species branch.
 The arrival point corresponds to a recombination event in an ancestral
 recombination graph (ARG).
 As the reference tree traverses a genome alignment to meet a recombinant
 edge, its sister branch of the arrival point is erased and the recombinant
 edge replaces it.
 Consequently, gene trees change sequentially along a genome.
 This reminisces about gene conversion modeling by

 developed a method of reconciling rooted gene trees with their reference
 species tree.
 Their implementation, called Mowgli, can infer the most parsimonious gene
 duplication, loss, and transfer events for gene families.
 Transferred genes in Mowgli can replace indigenous homologous copies in
 the recipient bacteria, or can integrate into the recipient bacterial genome.
 Mowgli allows study of gene flow events due to non-recombining horizontal
 transfer of gene segments, which is fortunate becasue it complement ClonalOrigi
n's capability of inferring gene flow due to bacterial recombination.
 Yet, both of the methods of ClonalOrgin and Mowgli take advantage of incompatib
ility of gene trees with a reference species tree.
 The very incompatibility allows these methods to detect gene transfer between
 species.
 While ClonalOrigin was able to handle core genomes, Mowgli was able to
 hand pan genomes.

Last paragraph before methods:
\series default
 The development of methods of analyzing DNA sequences together with recent
 release of bacterial genomes of SPY and SDE provided us with opportunity
 of studying gene transfer using whole bacterial genomes.
 We hoped that this study could further step towards the understanding of
 interaction between the two closely related human pathogens.
 Specifically, we wished to answer to three questions: Firstly, did two
 species exchange genetic segments across the entire genome or parts of
 the genome? What proportion of the genome underwent higher transfer of
 genes due to bacterial recombination or horizontal transfer? Secondly,
 was the transfer of genes balanced or unbalanced if the two pyogenic species
 exchanged genetic segments? Thirdly, what functional categories of genes
 were exchanged more often than others if they exchanged genetic material?
 Were virulence genes exchanged more often than non-virulence genes? We
 organize the remainder of the paper as follows.
 We describe the data set and its analysis in Methods and Materials.
 In Results, we provide evidence supporting our answers to the questions
 above, and end in Discussion.

 Two stages of MCMC with ClonalOrigin were employed as described in

 The first MCMC was used to obtain an estimate of population parameters

 The second stage of MCMC with ClonalOrigin was executed with the population
 parameters fixed to the estimated values in the first stage.
 This allowed to obtain a posterior sample of recombinant edges given population

 Two independent runs of the first Markov chain Monte Carlo of ClonalOrigin

 Note that we call a recombinant tree a species tree with recombinant edges

 We summarized the posterior sample to examine aspects of recombinant trees.
 First, we counted recombinant edges regardless of their start and end positions.
 Number of recombination events were calculated for each of pairs of donor
 and recipient branches of the reference species tree, which would indicate
 the degree to which the clonal species tree was disrupted by bacterial
 recombination.
 Comparison of numbers of recombination events from different pairs of donor

 summarized recombination events along a genome by measuring the effect
 of donor branches on a recipient species tree branch.
 By following their idea of summarizing recombination events along genomic
 locations we measured surrogate recombination intensity along genomic locations.
 The surrogate measure of recombination intensity might not be biologically
 meaningful.
 Yet, we hoped that the measure could discriminate between relative intensity
 values of bacterial recombination along a genome.
 We quantified how many types of recombinant edges affected each site along
 a genome.
 A type of recombinant edge is specified by its departure and arrival branches
 of a reference species tree.
 Note that departure branches are donors, and arrival branches are recipients.
 Using site-wise numbers of recombinant edge types we computed the mean
 value of the first surrogate measure of recombinantion for a geneic region.
 Then, we could study genes that could undergo higher recombination by finding
 functional categories enriched with genes with higher measures of recombination
 using Gene Ontology.

\begin_layout Subsection
Recombination intensity per recombinant edge type and genes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A recombinant tree with an alignment block tells what types of recombinant
 edges affect a column of the block.
 Because we would have a number recombinant edges sampled from the posterior
 distribution of recombinant trees, we could calculate the posterior probability
 that a site was affected by a recombinant edge type specified by the ordered
 pair of two branches.
 Interpreting recombinant edges as genomic segment flow needs to be warned
 because the departure and arrival points of a recombinant edge do not happen
 at the same time.
 Not all types of the recombinant edges can correspond to legitimate pairs
 of species tree branches for gene flow because some of branch pairs did
 not coexist at any past in time.
 A recombinant edge that departs from a root edge of a spcies tree and arrives
 at a leaf edge cannot be considered a channel for gene flow that connects
 the two species tree branches.
 Among the 60 types of recombinant edges 32 pairs of branches are those
 for recombinant edge types that can be considered as gene flow channels
 in an ultrametric species tree with five taxa.
 The posterior probability of a site experiencing gene flow due to a recombinant
 edge type was plotted along genomes of the five species as well as their
 ancestors.

 that were at extant nodes, we considered pairs of species tree branches
 one from SPY, and another pairs from SDE as gene flow channels.
 Four ordered pairs of species branches represented gene flow from SPY to
 SDE.
 Another four ordered pairs represented gene flow from SDE to SPY.
 Averaging the posterior probabilities over the four possible recombinant
 edge types and lengths of genic regions we measured the probability that
 a gene experiences genetic movement by one direction from SDE to SPY or
 the reverse direction.
 This allowed us to examine gene categories that experience one direction
 of gene flow more often than the other.

Gene tree topologies vary along the genome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[I NEED TO DESCRIBE REASONS WHY CHANGES OF LOCAL GENE TREE TOPOLOGIES ARE
 INTERESTING.] Local gene trees can be derived from a recombinant tree, or
 a species tree and its attached recombinant edges, for all of the sites
 of the alignment.
 Changes to local gene trees along multiple sequence alignments can involve
 changes in gene tree topology where recombinant edges start and end in
 the alignment.
 Not all recombinant edges change local gene tree topologies.
 Recombinant edges that depart from a species tree branch and arrive at
 the direct descendent of the branch may not change tree topologies.
 We have a posterior sample of gene tree topologies along alignment blocks
 by numbering gene tree topologies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g.,"
key "Rohlf1983"

\end_inset

.
 For a genic region of an alignment block we can measure a few different
 aspects of gene tree topologies: the number of tree topology changes, the
 proportion of sites where local gene tree topologies are different from
 the reference species tree topology, and the number of unique local gene
 tree topologies.
 Each of these aspects can be correlated with bacterial recombination.
 Because a simulation study showed that the number of unique gene tree topologie
s of a geneic region could be correlated with true values (FIGURE), we tried
 to associate the number of unique gene tree topologies with functional
 categories.

Data sets were simulated under the ClonalOrigin model.
 The three main parameters were set to the values that had been estimated

6, and the average recombinant tract length was set to 743.702415841584.
 There were 274 blocks, lengths of which were the same as those of the real
 data set.
 Using the recombination rate and the average recombinant track length we
 simulated 10 recombinant trees along all of the blocks given the species

 The mutation rate and each of the recombinant trees were used to simulate

 All of the 10 estimates of the mutation rate and the recombination rate
 were close to the true parameter value: the mean of the 10 estimates of
 the mutation rate was 0.08088 (SD 1.106735e-03), and those for the recombination
 rate was 0.01095 (SD 2.555159e-04).
 The mean of the 10 estimates of the recombinant tract length was 918.5(SD

 This was not surprising because 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Each of the recombinant trees was used to simulate 10 sets of 274 alignment

 Because we were not aware of a way to compare two recombinant trees, we
 could not compare the true recombinant tree with a posterior sample of

 We instead compared the three aspects of recombinant trees in the ClonalOrigin

 Here we showcase a study that polarized direction of gene flow seems broadly
 distributed across the entire genome.
 Additionally, we found functional categories that were under higher recombinati
on, and consequently targets of lateral gene transfer.
 Separate studies of association of those functional categories with lateral
 gene transfer had been done.
 These fortified our finding of association of those functional categories
 with higher recombination.
 We asked and answer to three questions.
 How did SDE evolve? Did it evolve from an ancestral form of pathogenic
 bateria? Did it evolve from a commensal bacteria? Did genetic elements
 transfer from SPY's lineage to SDE's? Or, were there cases of the opposite
 direction of gene flow? In this study, we wish to catalogue genetic elements
 according to their pattern of flow in the evolutionary history that relates
 SPY and SDE.

 conjectured two hypothetical scenarios of the evolution of the two species:
 The first one is that the most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is
 a GAS-like pathogen.
 SDE was losing virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor.
 SDE regains virulence factors from SPY because of the same niche.
 The second one is that the most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is
 a GGS/GCS-like commensal.
 SPY evolves virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor.
 SDE gains virulence factors from SPY.

 Gene exchange via recombination among bacteria has been a driving force

 Bacterial recombinations happen more freely within the same species.
 Barriers to bacterial recombination can include geographic isolation.
 Geographic isolation cannot be the only reason.
 Genetic isolation can prevent recombination between coinhating bacteria.

 Considering the observation that recombination events happen across the
 entire genome, we did not expect that some genes could be associated with
 higher recombination.
 We did find that ClonalOrigin's framework could help discover functional
 categories of genes with higher recombination.
 Some of functional categories are a classical example where genes with
 the corresponding function were under higher recombination, consequently
 leading to be under the force of lateral gene transfer.
 A functional category of tRNA aminoacylation were reportedly associated
 with higher lateral gene transfer by

 We could not rule out that virulence genes were transferred to

 The reports that

 The species might have been human-pathogenic, and they were not reported

What did we learn from the analysis of ClonalOrigin? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without account of recombination it seems to hard to study bacterial evolution
 with a few exceptions.
 Our study is just a showcase of using a recently developed statistical
 software of ClonalOrigin to apply it to two groups of genomes to answer
 three questions.
 Although the analysis using ClonalOrigin requires a series of analyses,
 the approach is based on a sound statistical model of coalescent with recombina
tion.

\begin_layout Subsection
Lack of analyses and Limitations of the method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used only two genomes of 
\emph on
S.
 pyogenes
\emph default
, and two genomes of 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
 with additional genome from 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
dysgalactiae
\emph default
.
 In additional to the five genomes analyses with more genomes from closely
 related species could increase the power of detecting recombination.
 Analyses with more isolates could potentially reveal congruent relationships
 between virulence profiles and GCS/GGS disease propensity.
 We also used only core genomes where not so much gaps were allowed 
\family typewriter
[Matt's analysis may complement ClonalOrigin's analysis]
\family default
.
 Relatively short alignment blocks were excluded from the analysis.
 Alignment blocks with many gaps were excluded.
 With this inherent filtering of the input data preparation we did not account
 for gene gain and loss in the analysis.
 Only well aligned regions were used in the analysis.
 More complicated evolutionary models could have been considered: genome
 rearrangement, gene segment gain and loss, and gene duplications.
 Without these evolutionary events in their model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 still used the two stages of Bayesian approach where the second stage uses
 the result from the first stage as a prior.
 If this compromise seems to be necessary due to smaller uncertainty of
 some parameters and computational cost, using whole genomes intact with
 all alignment blocks seems to be impracticable.
 Incorporating the other evolutionary events in the ClonalOrigin's framework
 seems to be out of the question.
 It seems to be natural to consider some of evolutionary models such as
 gene segment gain and loss becasue bacterial genomes are the ultimate resources
 for resolving many biological questions such as species tree of them.
 We are wondering if species tree can be studied using gene tree model that

 A demographic model could be made with two species to study the divergence

\begin_layout Standard
New functions of bacteria appear to emerge more easily in horizontal way
 than in vertical way.
 When one species of bacteria thrives in its environment and another relatively
 close species starts to cohabit with the indigenous species, some genetic
 elements in one of the two species would benefit another species.
 If the two species do not compete with each other, then the increased genetic
 variation from multiple species would eventually bring advantage to both
 of the species.
 Pathogenicity of bacteria should be no exception.
 Studying pathogenic gene flow should shed light on the etiology of the
 bacterial pathogens.

The observed number of recombination events for a donor/recipient pair is
 equal to the inferred number of recombinant edges across all of the alignment
 blocks.
 The prior expected number of recombination events given a global recombination
 rate is approximated using Equation 7 in

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practically, the prior expected number of recombination events was computed
 per block using ClonalOrigin.
 The point estimate of the ratio was the average value of the ratio over
 all the posterior sample.
 The sample variable of the ratio was also computed over the posterior sample.
 We interpreted the ratio of recombination events for a given donor/recipient
 pair as a measure of gene flow from a donor to a recipient species tree
 branch.

Numer of recombination events.
 The diagonal dashed lines are a line with slope of 1 and intercept of 0.
 For each order pairs of branches of a reference species tree the true number
 of recombination events is computed as the mean of the 10 replicates of
 recombinant trees from the simulation.
 With ten estimates of each replicate total number of 100 estimats are shown
 as intervals of 90% of quantile range, or the lower value of the interval
 is the 5% quantile, and the upper one is the 95% quantile.
