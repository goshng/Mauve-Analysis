 (SDE) has long been thought of as a veterinary pathogen, but recent evidence
 suggests that it can cause serious and life-threatening human diseases
 traditionally associated with SPY.
 Because these two species cohabit the same ecological niche, genetic exchanges
 between the two groups are likely.
 In this study we explore patterns of recombination between these species,
 as well as rates of duplication, loss, and transfer.
 One question we are trying to address is whether these genetic exchanges
 from SPY to SDE could have played a role in the formation of pathogenicity
 of SDE.
 Previous studies were limited to housekeeping genes partly because of a
 lack of methods for studying bacterial recombination on the genome scale,
 and partly due to unavailability of relevant bacterial genomes.
 The results enable us to create a map of recombination rates across each
 genome.
 We observe high variation in recombination rates, including several loci
 which seem to be hotspots for bacterial recombination.
 We find that there appears to be more gene flow from SPY to SDE than in
 the other direction.
 We find that duplications are most often species-specific.
 Â Many gene losses likely represent horizontal transfers that replace the
 native gene sequence.
 A gene ontology (GO) analysis suggests that categories having to do with
 sugar phosphotransferase and fatty acid biosynthesis may be enriched for
 high levels of recombination.

 developed a powerful statistical method, and implemented it into a software
 called ClonalOrigin.
 The method uses a reference species tree inferred using bacterial genomes.
 The reference species tree serves as a back-bone where additional edges,
 hereafter referred to as recombinant edges, are attached to the species
 tree branches.
 A recombinant edge connects two branches of the reference tree.
 The authors describe that a recombinant edge ``departs'' from an older
 time point at a species branch, and ``arrives'' at a more recent time point
 of another species branch.
 The arrival point corresponds to a recombination event in an ancestral
 recombination graph (ARG).
 As the reference tree traverses a genome alignment to meet a recombinant
 edge, its sister branch of the arrival point is erased and the recombinant
 edge replaces it.
 Consequently, gene trees change sequentially along a genome.
 This reminisces about gene conversion modeling by

 Their implementation, called Mowgli, can infer the most parsimonious gene
 duplication, loss, and transfer events for gene families.
 Laterally transferred genes in Mowgli can replace endogenous homologous

 Mowgli allows study of gene flow events due to nonrecombining

\begin_layout Standard
The development of methods of analyzing DNA sequences together with recent
 release of bacterial genomes of SPY and SDE provides us with opportunity
 of studying lateral gene transfer using whole bacterial genomes.
 We hope that this study could further step towards the understanding of
 interaction between the two closely related human pathogens.
 Specifically, we wish to answer to three questions: Firstly, did two species
 exchange genetic segments across the entire genome or parts of the genome?
 What proportion of the genome underwent higher transfer of genes due to
 bacterial recombination and 
\emph on
de novo
\emph default
 integration? Secondly, was the lateral transfer of genes balanced or unbalanced
 if the two pyogenic species exchanged genetic segments? Thirdly, what functiona
l categories of genes were exchanged more often than others if they exchanged
 genetic material? Were virulence genes exchanged more often than non-virulence
 genes?

 The first MCMC was used to obtain an estimate of population parameters

 The second stage of MCMC with ClonalOrigin was executed with the population
 parameters fixed to the estimated values in the first stage.
 This allowed to obtain a posterior sample of recombinant edges given population

 Two independent runs of the first Markov chain Monte Carlo of ClonalOrigin

 The first 1,000,000 generations of each chain were discarded as burn-in.

Number of recombinant edges

We call a recombinant tree a species tree with recombinant edges attached
 to the species tree.
 Aspects of overall recombination intensity between a donor species and
 a recipient can be captured by the observed number of recombination events
 relative to the prior expected number of recombination events.
 Regardless of the start and end positions of recombinant edges along the
 genome alignment, the number of recombinant edges indicates the degree
 to which the clonal species tree is disrupted by bacterial recombination.
 By counting recombinant edges based on their departing and arrival branches
 of a species tree

 inferred relative strengths of bacterial recombination events.
 They summarized the number of recombination events inferred relative to
 its expected number under the prior of the ClonalOrigin model given recombinati
on rate for each pair of donor and recipient branches.
 We applied the method to the five streptococcus genomes to infer which
 types of bacterial recombination were more prevalent than which other types.
 Note that departure branches are donors, and arrival branches are recipients.
 Of more interest in our study is if there are unbalanced recombination
 events between two clades of SPY and SDE.

 summarized recombination events along a genome by measuring the effect
 of donor branches on a recipient species tree branch.
 By following their idea of summarizing recombination events along genomic
 locations we attempted to measure recombination intensity along genomic
 locations.
 Our surrogate measure of recombination intensity is not biologically meaningful.
 Yet, we hope that the measure can discriminate between relative intensity
 values of bacterial recombination along a genome.
 The first surrogate measure is to quantify how often a particular site
 along a genome is affected by bacterial recombination.
 We count recombinant edges on a site of a genome.
 A type of recombinant edge is specified by its departure and arrival branches
 of a reference species tree.
 Sixty different kinds of recombinant edges are possible in the species
 tree with five taxa.
 The number of recombinant edges for a site could present relative intensity
 of recombination along a genome.
 We also computed the mean value of the first surrogate measure of a geneic
 region so that we could study genes that underwent higher or lower recombinatio
n.
 The number of recombinant edges per site for a gene could allow us to study
 functional category association of genes using Gene Ontology (see below
 section Functional categories under recombination).

\begin_layout Subsection
Map of local gene trees and its usage of surrogate recombination intensity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the first surrogate measure of recombination intensity, we
 exploited local gene tree topologies for all of the sites along alignment
 blocks in order to compute a second surrogate measure of recombination
 intensity.
 A species tree and its attached recombinant edges, or a recombinant tree,
 along a multiple sequence alignment is equivalent to local gene trees derived
 from the recombinant tree for all of the sites of the alignment.
 Changes to local gene trees along multiple sequence alignments can involve
 changes in gene tree topology where recombinant edges start and end in
 the alignment.
 Not all recombinant edges change local gene tree topologies.
 Recombinant edges that depart from a species tree branch and arrive at
 the direct descendent of the branch may not change tree topologies.
 We summarized gene tree topologies

The three different aspects of summarizing local gene tree topologies along
 a genome were pursued: the number of tree topology changes along a multiple
 alignment, the proportion of sites of a genic region where local gene tree
 topologies are different from the reference species tree topology, and
 the number of unique local gene tree topologies of a geneic region.
 These can serve as a surrogate for recombination intensity on a genic region.
 Counting tree topology changes on a subregion of a multiple alignment,
 or a gene within the multiple alignment, can allow a surrogate quantification
 of recombination intensity on a gene as the first surrogate measure of
 recombination intensity.

Recombination intensity per recombinant edge type and genes

\begin_layout Standard
A site of a multiple alignment can be affected by a particular recombinant
 edge.
 Focusing on a particular type of recombinant edge we could calculate the
 probability that a site experiences genetic movement by the recombinant
 edge type by averaging over all the posterior sample of recombinant edges.
 Furthremore, we could measure the average probability that a gene experiences
 genetic movement by a recombinant edge type by average over all the sites
 of a genic region.
 Enrichment of functional categories using the average probability of genes
 experiencing genetic movement was employed using Gene Ontology (

Interpreting recombinant edges as genomic segment flow needs to be warned
 because the departure and arrival do not happen at the same time.
 Among the 60 types of recombinant edges 32 pairs of branches are possible
 in an ultrametric species tree with five taxa.
 Not all types of the recombinant edges can correspond to legitimate pairs
 of species tree branches for gene flow because some of branch pairs did
 not coexist at any past in time.
 A recombinant edge that departs from a root edge of a spcies tree and arrives
 at a leaf edge cannot be considered a channel for gene flow that connects
 the two species tree branches.

 I downloaded JCVI loci information of SPY1 genome at http://cmr.jcvi.org.
 I searched the JCVI CMV website for SPY1 genome to list JCVI loci.
 I compared JCVI loci and NCBI locus_tag to find one-to-one association
 between JCVI locus and NCCI locus_tag.
 I downloaded bcp_go_role_link and bcp_role_link at ftp://ftp.jcvi.org/pub/data/Om
niome_Database/tab_delimited_omniome.
 I used bcp_go_role_link to find gene ontology annotations for the JCVI
 loci.
 The one-to-one associations were used to assign NCBI loci with their gene
 ontology annotations and JCVI role annotations.
 I listed roles at http://cmr.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/CMR/shared/RoleList.cgi and
 parsed the HTML source to find role categories and their identifiers.
 For JCVI roles I can group locus tags by main roles or submain roles using
 the numbers.
 I measured recombination intensity of a gene.
 Recombination intensity of a gene is an average weighted over the length
 of the gene in nucleotide.
 For each functional category of JCVI roles I divided genes into two groups
 where one consists of genes with the corresponding functional category
 and another of genes not annotated with the category.
 Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were performed for each functional
 category.
 I also used the category of virulence genes from Davies2007 to test if
 virulence genes were under higher or lower recombination.

 Additionally, we found functional categories that were under higher recombinati

 Separate studies of association of those functional categories with lateral
 gene transfer had been done.
 These fortified our finding of association of those functional categories
 with higher recombination.
 We asked and answer to three questions.
 How did SDE evolve? Did it evolve from an ancestral form of pathogenic
 bateria? Did it evolve from a commensal bacteria? Did genetic elements
 transfer from SPY's lineage to SDE's? Or, were there cases of the opposite
 direction of gene flow? In this study, we wish to catalogue genetic elements

 The first one is that the most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is

 SDE was losing virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor.
 SDE regains virulence factors from SPY because of the same niche.
 The second one is that the most recent common ancestor of SPY and SDE is
 a GGS/GCS-like commensal.
 SPY evolves virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor.

 Considering the observation that recombination events happen across the

 higher recombination.
 We did find that ClonalOrigin's framework could help discover functional
 categories of genes with higher recombination.
 Some of functional categories are a classical example where genes with
 the corresponding function were under higher recombination, consequently
 leading to be under the force of lateral gene transfer.

 Other corroborating studies seems to support that the three function categories
 were under relatively higher recombination.

Evoultion from commensal to pathogenic

Commensal bacteria could evolve by aquiring virulence genes from its closely
 related bacteria that are pathogenic.
 We expected that virulence genes of 
\emph on

 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
 might have been transferred from 
\emph on
S.
 pyogenes

 We could not find evidence to support the lateral gene transfer of virulence
 genes from 
\emph on
S.
 pyogenes
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
.
 This marginally appears to support that virulence genes might have existed
 in the common ancester of the two species.
 We could not rule out that virulence genes were transferred to 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
.
 The reports that 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae

 ssp.
 
\emph on

\emph default
 were human-pathogens seem to be retropective.
 
\emph on
Streptococcus dysgalactiae

 Recently, reports that

 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
 (SDE) were recovered as human pathogens just like 
\emph on

 (SPY) are increasing (CITEs).
 The species might have been human-pathogenic, and they were not reported
 to be so much as 
\emph on

.
 Further studies should be pursued to resolve this issue of lateral gene
 transfer of virulence genes.

\begin_layout Subsection
What did we learn from the analysis of ClonalOrigin? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without account of recombination it seems to hard to study bacterial evolution
 with a few exceptions.
 Our study is just a showcase of using a recently developed statistical
 software of ClonalOrigin to apply it to two groups of genomes to answer
 three questions.
 Although the analysis using ClonalOrigin requires a series of analyses,
 the approach is based on a sound statistical model of coalescent with recombina
tion.

\begin_layout Subsection
Lack of analyses and Limitations of the method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used only two genomes of 
\emph on
S.
 pyogenes
\emph default
, and two genomes of 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
 with additional genome from 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
dysgalactiae
\emph default
.
 In additional to the five genomes analyses with more genomes from closely
 related species could increase the power of detecting recombination.
 Analyses with more isolates could potentially reveal congruent relationships
 between virulence profiles and GCS/GGS disease propensity.
 We also used only core genomes where not so much gaps were allowed 
\family typewriter
[Matt's analysis may complement ClonalOrigin's analysis]
\family default
.
 Relatively short alignment blocks were excluded from the analysis.
 Alignment blocks with many gaps were excluded.
 With this inherent filtering of the input data preparation we did not account
 for gene gain and loss in the analysis.
 Only well aligned regions were used in the analysis.
 More complicated evolutionary models could have been considered: genome
 rearrangement, gene segment gain and loss, and gene duplications.
 Without these evolutionary events in their model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 still used the two stages of Bayesian approach where the second stage uses
 the result from the first stage as a prior.
 If this compromise seems to be necessary due to smaller uncertainty of
 some parameters and computational cost, using whole genomes intact with
 all alignment blocks seems to be impracticable.
 Incorporating the other evolutionary events in the ClonalOrigin's framework
 seems to be out of the question.
 It seems to be natural to consider some of evolutionary models such as
 gene segment gain and loss becasue bacterial genomes are the ultimate resources
 for resolving many biological questions such as species tree of them.
 We are wondering if species tree can be studied using gene tree model that

Divergence time estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kalia2001 suggested the divergence time of _S.
 dysgalactiae_ ssp.
 _dysgalactiae_ (SDD) to be around the time when human started to domesticate
 wildlife animals around 10,000 years ago.
 A demographic model could be made with two species to study the divergence
 time quantitatively.
 This would require ancestral recombination graphs embedded in a species
 tree.

 Computing the ratio of observed and expected numbers of recombination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observed number of recombination events for a donor/recipient pair is
 equal to the inferred number of recombinant edges across all of the alignment
 blocks.
 The prior expected number of recombination events given a global recombination
 rate is approximated using Equation 7 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Didelot2010"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practically, the prior expected number of recombination events was computed
 per block using ClonalOrigin.
 The point estimate of the ratio was the average value of the ratio over
 all the posterior sample.
 The sample variable of the ratio was also computed over the posterior sample.
 We interpreted the ratio of recombination events for a given donor/recipient
 pair as a measure of gene flow from a donor to a recipient species tree
 branch.
