 (SDE) has long been thought of as a veterinary pathogen, but evidence has
 emerged that it can cause serious and life-threatening human diseases tradition
ally associated with SPY.
 Because they cohabit the same ecological niche, genetic exchanges between
 SPY and SDE are likely.
 In this study we explored patterns of recombination in these species, as
 well as duplication, loss, and transfer of their genes.
 We attempted to address a question of whether genetic exchanges between
 SPY and SDE could have played a role in the formation of pathogenicity
 of SDE.
 Previous studies were limited to relatively small portion of a genome partly
 because of lack of methods for studying bacterial recombination on the
 genome scale, and partly due to unavailability of relevant bacterial genomes.
 The results allowed us to create a map of relative recombination rates
 across most of parts of the genomes of the species.
 We observed high variation in the recombination rates, including several
 loci which appeared to be hotspots for bacterial recombination.
 We found marginally supporting evidence that there appeared to be relatively
 more genomic flow from SPY to SDE than in the other direction based on
 bacterial recombination as surrogate measure of genomic flow.
 Reconciliation of species tree and gene trees based on gene fragments provided
 evidence that virulence genes appeared to undergo horizontal gene transfer
 than non-virulence genes.
 On the contrary, genomic flow due to bacterial recombination was not found
 to be associated with virulence genes.
 This might indicate that additional genes obtained via horizontal gene
 transfer were more effective than gene fragments transfer via bacterial
 recombination for pathogenic bacteria to acquire biological functions that
 were critical to their survival in the environment in which their close
 relatives thrived.

Bacteria evolve vertically and horizontally.
 Vertically, bacteria evolve clonally: parents pass their genetic contents
 down to their daughter cells.
 Mutations during the vertical evolution accumulate, which allows bacterial
 species to diverge in their genomic contents.
 Horizontally, bacteria obtain parts of genomes from others via conjugation
 by plasmid, transduction by bacteriophages, or transformation of naked
 DNA uptake

 Acquired DNAs can either replace their indigenous homologs, or be added
 to their recipient bacterial genomes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g.,"

\end_inset

.
 The former process involves bacterial recombination, and the latter horizontal
 transfer of DNA fragments.
 We wish to ditinguish gene transfer due to bacterial homologous recombination
 from additional gene fragments to a recipient bacterium due to horizontal
 gene transfer.
 Note that we discriminate between the two processes throughout the manuscript.
 Both of the processes result in gene transfer from a donor to a recipient.
 Genes are presumed to be parts of regions of a genome not necessarily protein-c
oding DNAs.
 New functions of bacteria appear to emerge more easily in horizontal way
 than in vertical way.
 When one species of bacteria thrives in its environment and another relatively
 close species starts to cohabit with the indigenous species, some genetic
 elements in one of the two species would benefit another species.
 If the two species do not compete with each other, then the increased genetic
 variation from multiple species would eventually bring advantage to both
 of the species.
 Pathogenicity of bacteria should be no exception.
 Studying pathogenic gene flow should shed light on the etiology of the
 bacterial pathogens.

 developed a powerful statistical method, and implemented it into a software
 called ClonalOrigin.
 The method uses a reference species tree inferred using bacterial genomes.
 The reference species tree serves as a back-bone where additional edges,
 hereafter referred to as recombinant edges, are attached to the species
 tree branches.
 A recombinant edge connects two branches of the reference tree.
 The authors describe that a recombinant edge ``departs'' from an older
 time point at a species branch, and ``arrives'' at a more recent time point
 of another species branch.
 The arrival point corresponds to a recombination event in an ancestral
 recombination graph (ARG).
 As the reference tree traverses a genome alignment to meet a recombinant
 edge, its sister branch of the arrival point is erased and the recombinant
 edge replaces it.
 Consequently, gene trees change sequentially along a genome.
 This reminisces about gene conversion modeling by

 developed a method of reconciling rooted gene trees with their reference
 species tree.
 Their implementation, called Mowgli, can infer the most parsimonious gene
 duplication, loss, and transfer events for gene families.
 Transferred genes in Mowgli can replace indigenous homologous copies in
 the recipient bacteria, or can integrate into the recipient bacterial genome.
 Mowgli allows study of gene flow events due to non-recombining horizontal
 transfer of gene segments, which is fortunate becasue it complement ClonalOrigi
n's capability of inferring gene flow due to bacterial recombination.
 Yet, both of the methods of ClonalOrgin and Mowgli take advantage of incompatib
ility of gene trees with a reference species tree.
 The very incompatibility allows these methods to detect gene transfer between
 species.
 While ClonalOrigin was able to handle core genomes, Mowgli was able to
 hand pan genomes.
 [DESCRIPTION OF PARTS WHERE EACH OF THE TWO METHODS IS STRONGER THAN THE
 OTHER!]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of methods of analyzing DNA sequences together with recent
 release of bacterial genomes of SPY and SDE provided us with opportunity
 of studying lateral gene transfer using whole bacterial genomes.
 We hoped that this study could further step towards the understanding of
 interaction between the two closely related human pathogens.
 Specifically, we wished to answer to three questions: Firstly, did two
 species exchange genetic segments across the entire genome or parts of
 the genome? What proportion of the genome underwent higher transfer of
 genes due to bacterial recombination or horizontal transfer? Secondly,
 was the transfer of genes balanced or unbalanced if the two pyogenic species
 exchanged genetic segments? Thirdly, what functional categories of genes
 were exchanged more often than others if they exchanged genetic material?
 Were virulence genes exchanged more often than non-virulence genes?

 ClonalOrigin takes a reference species tree and uses an MCMC framework

 ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs).
 Two stages of MCMC with ClonalOrigin were employed as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

.
 The first MCMC was used to obtain an estimate of population parameters
 including mutation rate, recombination rate, and recombinant tract length.
 The second stage of MCMC with ClonalOrigin was executed with the population
 parameters fixed to the estimated values in the first stage.
 This allowed to obtain a posterior sample of recombinant edges given population
 parameters and the species tree.
 Two independent runs of the first Markov chain Monte Carlo of ClonalOrigin
 were executed with a total generation of each chain being 11,000,000.
 The first 1,000,000 generations of each chain were discarded as burn-in.
 The remaining 10,000,000 generations were subsampled every 100,000-th generatio

 Additionally, two independent chains of the second stage of ClonalOrigin's

The result of the second stage of ClonalOrigin MCMC was a posterior sample
 of sets of recombinant edges.
 A recombinant tree is referred to a species tree with recombinant edges
 attached to the species tree.
 We summarized the posterior sample to examine aspects of recombinant trees.
 First, we counted recombinant edges regardless of the start and end positions
 of the corresponding bacterial recombinations.
 Number of recombination events were calculated for each of pairs of donor
 and recipient branches of the reference species tree, which would indicate
 the degree to which the clonal species tree was disrupted by bacterial
 recombination.
 We could compare number of recombination events from different pairs of
 donor and recipient.
 This gave us insight into relative strength of genome-wide gene flow.

 inferred this relative strengths of bacterial recombination events.
 They summarized the number of recombination events inferred relative to
 its expected number under the prior of the ClonalOrigin model given recombinati
on rate for each pair of donor and recipient branches.
 We aplied the method to the five streptococcus genomes to infer which types
 of bacterial recombination were more prevalent than which other types.
 Note that departure branches are donors, and arrival branches are recipients.
 Of more interest in here our study is if there are unbalanced recombination
 events between two clades of SPY and SDE.

 summarized recombination events along a genome by measuring the effect
 of donor branches on a recipient species tree branch.
 By following their idea of summarizing recombination events along genomic
 locations we attempted to measure surrogate recombination intensity along
 genomic locations.
 Our surrogate measure of recombination intensity was not biologically meaningfu
l.
 Yet, we hoped that the measure could discriminate between relative intensity
 values of bacterial recombination along a genome.
 The first surrogate measure is to quantify how often a particular site
 along a genome is affected by bacterial recombination.
 We count recombinant edges on a site of a genome.
 A type of recombinant edge is specified by its departure and arrival branches
 of a reference species tree.
 Sixty different kinds of recombinant edges are possible in the species
 tree with five taxa under the ClonalOrigin model.
 The number of recombinant edges for a site could present relative intensity
 of recombination along a genome.
 We also computed the mean value of the first surrogate measure of a geneic
 region so that we could study genes that could undergo higher or lower
 recombination.
 The number of recombinant edges per site for a gene allowed us to study
 functional category association of genes using Gene Ontology (see section
 Functional categories under recombination).

In addition to the first surrogate measure of recombination intensity, we

 intensity.
 Local gene trees can be derived from a recombinant tree, or a species tree
 and its attached recombinant edges, for all of the sites of the alignment.
 Changes to local gene trees along multiple sequence alignments can involve
 changes in gene tree topology where recombinant edges start and end in
 the alignment.
 Not all recombinant edges change local gene tree topologies.
 Recombinant edges that depart from a species tree branch and arrive at
 the direct descendent of the branch may not change tree topologies.
 We summarized gene tree topologies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g.,"
key "Rohlf1983"

\end_inset

 along alignment blocks to have three surrogate recombination intensity:
 the number of tree topology changes along a multiple alignment, the proportion
 of sites of a genic region where local gene tree topologies are different
 from the reference species tree topology, and the number of unique local
 gene tree topologies of a geneic region.
 These can serve as a surrogate for recombination intensity on a genic region.
 Counting tree topology changes on a subregion of a multiple alignment,
 or a gene within the multiple alignment, can allow for a surrogate quantificati
on of recombination intensity on a gene as the first surrogate measure of
 recombination intensity.
 We studied functional category association of genes using unique number
 of gene tree topologies as a second surrogate measure of recombination
 intensity (see section Functional categories under recombination).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the two aspects of recombinant edges could be correlated with bacterial
 recombination, we used both of the surrogate measures of recombination
 intensity.
 The first measure was used to measure gene flows between a particular pairs
 of species branches in addition to quantification of overall recombination
 intensity.
 The second surrogate measure of recombination using gene tree topologies
 could be more conservative than that of the first measure of number of
 recombinant edges per site.
 This can be because certain recedges does not change gene tree topologies
 and the first measure still counts recombinant edges.
 A simulation study showed that the second measure of recombination behaved
 better than the first one, or better correlation with true value (FIGURE).

Recombination intensity per recombinant edge type and genes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned earlier, the first surrogate measure of recombination could
 be extended to a posterior probability of a site being affected by a particular
 ordered pairs of two branches of a reference species tree.
 Focusing on a specific type of recombinant edge we could calculate the
 posterior probability that a site experiences genetic movement by the recombina
nt edge type by averaging over all the posterior sample of recombinant edges.
 This could be interpreted as a posterior probability of the site having
 undergone transfer from one to another specified by the ordered pair of
 two branches.
 Interpreting recombinant edges as genomic segment flow needs to be warned
 because the departure and arrival do not happen at the same time.
 Among the 60 types of recombinant edges 32 pairs of branches are possible
 in an ultrametric species tree with five taxa.
 Not all types of the recombinant edges can correspond to legitimate pairs
 of species tree branches for gene flow because some of branch pairs did
 not coexist at any past in time.
 A recombinant edge that departs from a root edge of a spcies tree and arrives
 at a leaf edge cannot be considered a channel for gene flow that connects
 the two species tree branches.

 Furthremore, we could measure the average probability that a gene experiences

Simulation studies for checking ClonalOrigin's estimates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We applied a statistical approach implemented in ClonalOrigin to the data
 set of the five genomes.
 The implementation of ClonalOrigin was stable for production use.
 We checked how well ClonalOrigin could recover parameters of interest under
 the parameter setup that were inferred using the five genomes of streptococcus
 species.
 We hoped that we could understand the power and limitations of ClonalOrigin
 under the parameter setup that we inferred from our data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The three main parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data sets were simulated under the ClonalOrigin model.
 The three main parameters were set to the values that had been estimated
 using the five genomes of streptococcus species: the mutation rate per
 site was 0.080814517322956, the recombination rate per site was 0.011849128789476
6, and the average recombinant tract length was set to 743.702415841584.
 There were 274 blocks, lengths of which were the same as those of the real
 data set.
 Using the recombination rate and the average recombinant track length we
 simulated 10 recombinant trees along all of the blocks given the species
 tree that had been also estimated with ClonalFrame.
 The mutation rate and each of the recombinant trees were used to simulate
 274 alignment blocks with Jukes-Cantor model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 of DNA sequence evolution.
 Note that we employed no insertion-deletion models although there were
 several approaches available 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g.,"
key "Sipos2011"

\end_inset

.
 All of the 10 estimates of the mutation rate and the recombination rate
 were close to the true parameter value: the mean of the 10 estimates of
 the mutation rate was 0.08088 (SD 1.106735e-03), and those for the recombination
 rate was 0.01095 (SD 2.555159e-04).
 The mean of the 10 estimates of the recombinant tract length was 918.5(SD
 28.19219), which was larger than the true value by 175 base pairs.
 This was not surprising because 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Didelot2010"

\end_inset

 already noted that recombinant tract lengths were difficult to estimate
 due to relatively short lengths of alignment blocks.
 As alignment block lengths were increased (e.g., 10,000 base pairs long)
 with 100 blocks, we could estimate the average recombinant tract length
 accurately using ClonalOrigin [USE SIMULATION 6].

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the two stages of MCMC in ClonalOrigin we simulated more data
 sets to check how well ClonalOrigin inferred recombination events inaddition
 to the three main parameters.
 We used the same parameters in the first simulation.
 We further simulated 10 recombinant trees instead of a single recombinant
 tree.
 Each of the recombinant trees was used to simulate 10 sets of 274 alignment
 blocks with the same DNA sequence evolution model, or Jukes-Cantor model.
 Because we were not aware of a way to compare two recombinant trees, we
 could not compare the true recombinant tree with a posterior sample of
 recombinant trees.
 We instead compared the three aspects of recombinant trees in the ClonalOrigin
 model.
 The three aspects were already exploited in this study: the number of recombina
tion events between a donor and a recipient, and the two surrogate measures
 of recombination intensity.

 Here we showcase a study that polarized direction of gene flow seems broadly

 Additionally, we found functional categories that were under higher recombinati

 Separate studies of association of those functional categories with lateral
 gene transfer had been done.
 These fortified our finding of association of those functional categories
 with higher recombination.
 We asked and answer to three questions.
 How did SDE evolve? Did it evolve from an ancestral form of pathogenic
 bateria? Did it evolve from a commensal bacteria? Did genetic elements
 transfer from SPY's lineage to SDE's? Or, were there cases of the opposite
 direction of gene flow? In this study, we wish to catalogue genetic elements

 SDE was losing virulence factors since the divergence of the ancestor.
 SDE regains virulence factors from SPY because of the same niche.

 Two competing hypotheses on the evolution of the two species are tested.
 We provide more evidence for hypothesis 1 with detailed view of evolutionary

 Gene exchange via recombination among bacteria has been a driving force
 of bacterial evoltuion.
 Bacterial recombinations happen more freely within the same species.
 Barriers to bacterial recombination can include geographic isolation.
 Geographic isolation cannot be the only reason.
 Genetic isolation can prevent recombination between coinhating bacteria.

 We did not find evidence against the hypothesis that functional categories

 Genes associated with polarized gene flow seem to be more or less randomly

 Considering the observation that recombination events happen across the
 entire genome, we did not expect that some genes could be associated with
 higher recombination.
 We did find that ClonalOrigin's framework could help discover functional
 categories of genes with higher recombination.
 Some of functional categories are a classical example where genes with
 the corresponding function were under higher recombination, consequently
 leading to be under the force of lateral gene transfer.
 A functional category of tRNA aminoacylation were reportedly associated
 with higher lateral gene transfer by

 There are recent reports about tRNA aminoacylation

 We found that PTS in signal transduction was associated with higher recombinati

Evoultion from commensal to pathogenic

Commensal bacteria could evolve by aquiring virulence genes from its closely
 related bacteria that are pathogenic.
 We expected that virulence genes of

\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
 might have been transferred from 
\emph on

 We could not find evidence to support the lateral gene transfer of virulence
 genes from

S.
 pyogenes
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on

 This marginally appears to support that virulence genes might have existed
 in the common ancester of the two species.
 We could not rule out that virulence genes were transferred to 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
.
 The reports that 
\emph on

\emph on

 Recently, reports that

\emph on

\emph on

 (SPY) are increasing (CITEs).
 The species might have been human-pathogenic, and they were not reported
 to be so much as 
\emph on

.
 Further studies should be pursued to resolve this issue of lateral gene
 transfer of virulence genes.

What did we learn from the analysis of ClonalOrigin? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without account of recombination it seems to hard to study bacterial evolution
 with a few exceptions.
 Our study is just a showcase of using a recently developed statistical
 software of ClonalOrigin to apply it to two groups of genomes to answer
 three questions.
 Although the analysis using ClonalOrigin requires a series of analyses,
 the approach is based on a sound statistical model of coalescent with recombina
tion.

\begin_layout Subsection
Lack of analyses and Limitations of the method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used only two genomes of 
\emph on
S.
 pyogenes
\emph default
, and two genomes of 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
equisimilis
\emph default
 with additional genome from 
\emph on
S.
 dysgalactiae
\emph default
 ssp.
 
\emph on
dysgalactiae
\emph default
.
 In additional to the five genomes analyses with more genomes from closely
 related species could increase the power of detecting recombination.
 Analyses with more isolates could potentially reveal congruent relationships
 between virulence profiles and GCS/GGS disease propensity.
 We also used only core genomes where not so much gaps were allowed 
\family typewriter
[Matt's analysis may complement ClonalOrigin's analysis]
\family default
.
 Relatively short alignment blocks were excluded from the analysis.
 Alignment blocks with many gaps were excluded.
 With this inherent filtering of the input data preparation we did not account
 for gene gain and loss in the analysis.
 Only well aligned regions were used in the analysis.
 More complicated evolutionary models could have been considered: genome
 rearrangement, gene segment gain and loss, and gene duplications.
 Without these evolutionary events in their model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Didelot2010"

\end_inset

 still used the two stages of Bayesian approach where the second stage uses
 the result from the first stage as a prior.
 If this compromise seems to be necessary due to smaller uncertainty of
 some parameters and computational cost, using whole genomes intact with
 all alignment blocks seems to be impracticable.
 Incorporating the other evolutionary events in the ClonalOrigin's framework
 seems to be out of the question.
 It seems to be natural to consider some of evolutionary models such as
 gene segment gain and loss becasue bacterial genomes are the ultimate resources
 for resolving many biological questions such as species tree of them.
 We are wondering if species tree can be studied using gene tree model that

Divergence time estimation

\begin_layout Standard
Kalia2001 suggested the divergence time of _S.
 dysgalactiae_ ssp.
 _dysgalactiae_ (SDD) to be around the time when human started to domesticate
 wildlife animals around 10,000 years ago.
 A demographic model could be made with two species to study the divergence
 time quantitatively.
 This would require ancestral recombination graphs embedded in a species
 tree.

 Computing the ratio of observed and expected numbers of recombination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observed number of recombination events for a donor/recipient pair is
 equal to the inferred number of recombinant edges across all of the alignment
 blocks.
 The prior expected number of recombination events given a global recombination
 rate is approximated using Equation 7 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Didelot2010"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practically, the prior expected number of recombination events was computed
 per block using ClonalOrigin.
 The point estimate of the ratio was the average value of the ratio over
 all the posterior sample.
 The sample variable of the ratio was also computed over the posterior sample.
 We interpreted the ratio of recombination events for a given donor/recipient
 pair as a measure of gene flow from a donor to a recipient species tree
 branch.

Numer of recombination events.
 The diagonal dashed lines are a line with slope of 1 and intercept of 0.
 For each order pairs of branches of a reference species tree the true number
 of recombination events is computed as the mean of the 10 replicates of
 recombinant trees from the simulation.
 With ten estimates of each replicate total number of 100 estimats are shown
 as intervals of 90% of quantile range, or the lower value of the interval
 is the 5% quantile, and the upper one is the 95% quantile.
