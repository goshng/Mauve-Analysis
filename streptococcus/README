Genomes
-------
There are 14 genomes.
- S. pyogenes (5):
NC_002737.gbk
NC_003028.gbk
NC_003098.gbk
NC_003485.gbk
NC_004070.gbk

- S. pneumoniae (2):
NC_004116.gbk
NC_004350.gbk

- S. mutans (1):
NC_004368.gbk

- S. agalactiae (3):
NC_006448.gbk
NC_006449.gbk
NC_007432.gbk

- S. thermophilus (3):
NC_008022.gbk
NC_008023.gbk
NC_008532.gbk

run-mauve-genome26
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I intend to align 26 genomes that Tristan and Stanhope used in their 2007 Genome
Biology paper. Six if the genomes are unavailable as a whole genome, which does
not allow me to use the 6 genomes in the alignment. I aligned only 20 genomes.
The 6 genomes include 5 S. agalactiae and 1 S. suis, all of which are available
as WGS not complete. S. thermophilus LMD-9 strain was available as complete
genome at the time when I downloaded its genome from NCBI bacteria genome
FTP directory.

14 genomes
~~~~~~~~~~
Because mauve analysis is computationally expensive, I wanted to reduce the
number of genomes under analysis. Table 1 of Lefebure and Stanhope (2007) lists
26 genomes, among which 14 genomes are selected without consideration of
possible outcome of the analysis. Five S. pyogene genomes are selected at
random.


run-clonalframe
---------------
ClonalFrame is a slow MCMC procedure. It takes about 30 seconds per generation.
I submitted a job to CAC cluster with 3000 burnin and 3000 generations with 10
thinning interval. This would take about 2 days. 

It seems to take 1.7 min to iteratre one generation of MCMC of ClonalFrame. So,
it would take more than 3 weeks to iterate 20,000.

I subsample 10% of the full data set.
It takes 4.5 seconds to run a single generation of MCMC with 10% of the full
data set. We can run 100,000 within a week.

I can check the convergence using ClonalFrame's GUI program that is installed in
Swiftgen.
