run-mauve-genome26
------------------
I intend to align 26 genomes that Tristan and Stanhope used in their 2007 Genome
Biology paper. Six if the genomes are unavailable as a whole genome, which does
not allow me to use the 6 genomes in the alignment. I aligned only 20 genomes.
The 6 genomes include 5 S. agalactiae and 1 S. suis, all of which are available
as WGS not complete. S. thermophilus LMD-9 strain was available as complete
genome at the time when I downloaded its genome from NCBI bacteria genome
FTP directory.


run-clonalframe
---------------
ClonalFrame is a slow MCMC procedure. It takes about 30 seconds per generation.
I submitted a job to CAC cluster with 3000 burnin and 3000 generations with 10
thinning interval. This would take about 2 days. 

I can check the convergence using ClonalFrame's GUI program that is installed in
Swiftgen.
