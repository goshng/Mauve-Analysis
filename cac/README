Examples of Batch Scripts for running jobs at CAC Cluster
=========================================================

------------------------

Farm
----

Farm-fancy
----------
A working example of Farm-out-work fancy version. This can be found at
http://www.cac.cornell.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Farm-out-work.

Array
-----
It shows how PBS -t option is used.

warg-array
----------

warg-xjobs
----------

warg1
-----
Two stages of warg (clonalorigin) runs are required. warg1 is the directory of
the first run of warg.

warg2
-----
Ilan's code. wait bash command is used.
I think that xjobs does not work for me, either. I think that this 8
separate jobs are my best shot.

warg2star
---------
This is the final version of my experiment of running warg jobs in cluster.
I did experiment to run as many jobs of warg as possible in CAC cluster.
For some reasons, warg or clonalorigin software did not see eye to eye with any
of MPI-enabled batch scripts that were provided by CAC.

warg3
-----
CAC example using R script.
