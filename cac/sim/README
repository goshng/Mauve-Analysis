How to submit jobs to CAC
=========================

A short procedure
-----------------

. Create a directory ($PBS_O_WORKDIR) at the cluster.
. Copy the three shell script to the directory.
. Create a file called +jobidfile+ at the directory.
. Edit +batch.sh+ file and move input files to proper places.

Three shell scripts
-------------------
.+run.sh+
This is the start-up script that calls +batch.sh+. Simply, execute it using a
SHELL.

.batch.sh
Edit this file. The file has three parts: copy files from a storage directory to
a compute node, run any jobs in +jobidfile+, and copy resulting files back to
the storage directory. See the shell script for detail.
See also the section ``Prepare files for running them on compute nodes.''

.batch_task.sh
This contains a script that checks +jobidfile+ if there are any job command
left. If there are any scripts, it executes the first one in the list.

.batch_task2.sh


Prepare files for running them on compute nodes
-----------------------------------------------
To run jobs in compute nodes two things are necessary. Firstly, input files
including executables must be placed some where a compute node can access.
Secondly, a shell script that takes the input files to produce output files is
needed. This is too general. It is not useful in our specific context. Let's see
what I'd do for submitting jobs for the simulation.

Function copy-data in batch.sh is called first before
process-data and retrieve-data are called. All of input files and executables
are copied to the base directory called $TMPDIR. In the example, I copy warg
executable and a species tree file. The +batch_task.sh+ file is also copied.
I'd also need to create directories for input and output files. These commands
of input data preparation are executed in the function copy-data. Note that
directories for output files are also considered input files.

Function process-data does not need any edit except the number of processes.
Variable $CORESPERNODE can be changed to the number of CPUs in the compute node
to which a job is submitted.

function retrieve-data needs to be modified.
$PBS_O_WORKDIR is the directory where the three shell scripts are copied.
I'd copy all of the output files to $PBS_O_WORKDIR directory. 

Note that I also need to copy the input files to $DATABASE directory.
