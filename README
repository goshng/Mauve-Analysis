Mauve Analysis
==============

Directories
-----------

bacillus
~~~~~~~~

cac
~~~
Examples of batch scripts for submitting jobs to CAC cluster.

streptococcus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fourteen genomes are collated for a mauve analysis.

Problems
--------
ClonalFrame seems slow with increase in number of blocks.
Bacillus data set is hard to analyze with ClonalFrame. 
Streptococcus data set is smaller than Bacillus data set in size. 

streptococcus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
N=14, b=471, L=603426
means that 14 genomes share 471 blocks that combine to be 603,426 in characters.
It would take about a week to run 20,000 generations of MCMC.

bacillus
~~~~~~~~
N=13, b=1200, L=3596990
means that 13 genomes share 1,200 blocks that combine to be 3,596,990 in
characters. This would take 8 days (or more than a week) to run 8,000
generations of MCMC.
