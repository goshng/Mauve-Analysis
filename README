Mauve, Clonal Frame, Clonal Origin Analysis
===========================================

Bacteria species under study
----------------------------

bacillus
~~~~~~~~
A smaller data set seems to work with ClonalFrame.
I stopped at ClonalFrame's analysis with a smaller dataset.
I think that the running option that I use ClonalFrame seems okay.

Staphylococcus aureus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This should be analyzed similarly to that of B. cereus because recombination
rates seem comparable to those of B. cereus. The number of species is also
comparable.

Mauve alignment

Sulfolobus_islandicus
---------------------
There are 7 genomes.
Mauve alignment: PASS!
ClonalFrame (small): PASS!
ClonalOrigin: in progress...
This may be the first example that I can analyze with ClonalFrame and
ClonalOrigin.  

Sulfolobus
----------
Four more members of Sulfolobales are added.
There are 11 genome members of Sulfolobales.
Horizontal gene transfer can be studied using Clonal Origin.
Their timing can be summarized.


cornell6
--------
Two genomes sequenced at Cornell and four genomes publicly available are used. 

cornell5
--------
SEE is removed from the analysis of cornell6 because a whole genome may be
enough to root the tree, and the outgroup of SEE may not be necessary.
Two of three ClonalFrame runs seems concordant.  I proceed with the first stage
of ClonalOrigin analysis. 

spyogenes
---------
I used 13 genomes. Two runs did not converge. Clonal frame is hard to obtain.
One of two runs seems stucked at a tree, and mixing was bad.
One of the runs runs okay. This is encouraging (Note the spyogenes6 did not
work, or R value increases to reach a plateau. 

spyogenes6
-----------
Each of three pairs of genomes are from the same M type. I remove one of each
pair. I also remove some to make a set of 6 species. The idea is if MCMC chains
converge and mix with a smaller number of species.
I see a similar problem: R value increases to reach a plateau.
I turn to cornell5 data set.

Burkholderia_cenocepacia
------------------------
This archea species include 4 genomes. Interestingly each genome consists of
multiple circular chromosomes or 3 chromosome. I combine the multiple
chromosomes to a single one. This can serve as a genome for ClonalFrame
analysis.
The analysis of archea may be interesting.
[literal]
cat ~/Elements/Documents/Projects/mauve/bacteria/Burkholderia_cenocepacia_MC0_3_uid58769/*.gbk > 1.gbk
union -sequence 1.gbk -sformat genbank -outseq 2.gbk -osformat genbank -feature Y -auto
mv 2.gbk Burkholderia_cenocepacia_MC0_3.gbk
rm 1.gbk

Salmonella_enterica
-------------------
I do not know what brought me to analyze this.

Command Lines
-------------

To find genomes of a species
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[literal]
cd /Users/goshng/Elements/Documents/Projects/mauve/bacteria
[literal]
ls -l `find . -name *.gbk`| grep Staphylococcus_aureus > ~/Documents/Projects/mauve/species/Staphylococcus_aureus

To create a genome analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[literal]
bash sh/run.sh leptospira



Directories
-----------

cac
~~~
Examples of batch scripts for submitting jobs to CAC cluster.

streptococcus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fourteen genomes are collated for a mauve analysis.

Problems
--------
ClonalFrame seems slow with increase in number of blocks.
Bacillus data set is hard to analyze with ClonalFrame. 
Streptococcus data set is smaller than Bacillus data set in size. 

streptococcus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
N=14, b=471, L=603426
means that 14 genomes share 471 blocks that combine to be 603,426 in characters.
It would take about a week to run 20,000 generations of MCMC.

bacillus
~~~~~~~~
N=13, b=1200, L=3596990
means that 13 genomes share 1,200 blocks that combine to be 3,596,990 in
characters. This would take 8 days (or more than a week) to run 8,000
generations of MCMC.

External Programs
-----------------
Some perl scripts and c++ source files are prepared for helping mauve analyses.
- blocksplit2fasta.pl: A perl script that splits a core alignment to multiple
  fasta files. These fasta files are taken as input to
  compute_watterson_estimate to compute Watterson's estimate.
- blocksplit2smallerfasta.pl: A perl script that subsample blocks from a core
  alignment. 
- compute_watterson_estimate: A c++ source file that computes Watterson's
  estimates of DNA sequence alignments.

- Convert core to smaller core.
