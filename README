To find genomes of a species
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[literal]
cd /Users/goshng/Elements/Documents/Projects/mauve/bacteria
[literal]
ls -l `find . -name *.gbk`| grep Staphylococcus_aureus > ~/Documents/Projects/mauve/species/Staphylococcus_aureus

To create a genome analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[literal]
bash sh/run.sh leptospira



Directories
-----------

bacillus
~~~~~~~~

cac
~~~
Examples of batch scripts for submitting jobs to CAC cluster.

streptococcus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fourteen genomes are collated for a mauve analysis.

Problems
--------
ClonalFrame seems slow with increase in number of blocks.
Bacillus data set is hard to analyze with ClonalFrame. 
Streptococcus data set is smaller than Bacillus data set in size. 

streptococcus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
N=14, b=471, L=603426
means that 14 genomes share 471 blocks that combine to be 603,426 in characters.
It would take about a week to run 20,000 generations of MCMC.

bacillus
~~~~~~~~
N=13, b=1200, L=3596990
means that 13 genomes share 1,200 blocks that combine to be 3,596,990 in
characters. This would take 8 days (or more than a week) to run 8,000
generations of MCMC.

External Programs
-----------------
Some perl scripts and c++ source files are prepared for helping mauve analyses.
- blocksplit2fasta.pl: A perl script that splits a core alignment to multiple
  fasta files. These fasta files are taken as input to
  compute_watterson_estimate to compute Watterson's estimate.
- blocksplit2smallerfasta.pl: A perl script that subsample blocks from a core
  alignment. 
- compute_watterson_estimate: A c++ source file that computes Watterson's
  estimates of DNA sequence alignments.
