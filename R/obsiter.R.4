SPY1 SPY2 SPY -> SDE1 SDE2 SDE 
For each iteration of ClonalOrigin, or each recombinant tree,
sum of recombinant edges from SPY branches to SDE branches,
and sum of recombinant edges from SDE branches to SPY branches,
Take the ratio of the first to the second. The following quantile is
0.025, 0.5 or median, 0.0975 quantile values of the ratios of 1001 data points.
We obtained the ratio for the prior to count how many data points of the
1001 values less than the ratio for the prior.
The p-value is the fraction of them.
Quantile (0.025, 0.5 or median, 0.975) is 1.791531 1.993355 2.268775 
Mean is 2.000307
