There are two files, in.gene and ri1-refgenome4-map.gene. The first nine columns
of both of the files are the same as described below. The in.gene file contains
four more columns of numbers that are derived from gene tree topologies. As I
remember correctly, the 12th column (the number of unique gene tree topologies)
could be interesting because our simulation appeared to show good correlation
between true and estimates. The other file ri1-refgenome4-map.gene contains 9
more columns in addition to the first 9 columns. Eight columns (10 through 17)
are posterior probability that a particular recombinant recedges affect a site
of the corresponding gene. The last 18-th columns is the number of recombinant
edges per site that we used before.

Four kinds of association are of interest: 
1st: 12-th column of in.gene, 
2nd: sum of 10-th, 11-th, 12-th, 13-th of ri1-refgenome4-map.gene,
3rd: sum of 14-th, 15-th, 16-th, 17-th of ri1-refgenome4-map.gene, 
and 4th: 18-th of ri1-refgenome4-map.gene.

The 1st and 4th should be positively correlated in their results. The 2nd and
3rd associations might show different parts of functional categories that are
different in the direction between SDE and SPY, if there are any differences. 

in.gene
-------
1: gene name 
2: gene start position in the reference genome
3: gene end position in the reference genome
4: gene strand
5: block ID of the gene 
6: gene start position in the block
7: gene end position in the block 
8: gene length
9: proportion of gaps of the gene in the alignment
10: number of changes of gene tree topology
11: number of trees that are different from the species tree 
12: number of unique gene tree topologies
13: probability of experiencing gene tree topology change
